[o level] when to start studying for o levels,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586822493.0,"
hi guys, im just a random student hoping to gain some insight on when to start studying. since now its hbl, tbh im really ain't learning anything online and i used to rely on my tuition teacher for math as its always a f9-c5 so now i can't with math since tuition has been suspended. so i just wanted to know when did you guys or will you guys start studying for o levels? also study tips would be awesome! also since there is covid19 i heard subjects would have some topics being removed and would be mark leniently in the o levels. thanks in advance!

(subject combi: poa ,f&n, e geog, combined science)

In Poly, you‚Äôll have classes with the same group of classmates whom you‚Äôll see almost everyday and for a substantial period of time. You can have lunch together, go home together etc. You might not notice now but when you enter Uni, you‚Äôll really start to appreciate this group of friends / classmates that you have and see everyday in class. With the freedom given in University, there are no fixed classes. This means that for most of the time, you will probably see your classmates once a week.

Would definitely encourage you to join camps before school starts to expand your social circle (though not all camp friendships will last). If you can and have the intention to, staying in hall will definitely help in easing you in. That being said, even if you end up not attending any camps or staying in hall, it is not exactly impossible to find friends, just that it‚Äôll be much harder. You‚Äôll probably have to put in a little effort as a lot of people already have friends even before classes start. But really, once you are in Uni, you‚Äôll start to accept and appreciate being alone and going solo. \n\nStudy wise, the teaching style and approach is largely the same as in Poly, though the workload is definitely much heavier. You are also expected to be more independent in Uni. This means no lecturers being there to spoon feed you and guide you along the way. For BBA at least, there is really no point in doing prior reading as everything will pretty much be covered in class.

[o level] REALLY unmotivated & need help for certain subs :/,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586797088.0,"hi so this hbl period has been HELL for me, not like literal, suffering but im stressed over the fact that im not stressed? if that makes sense. ive been binging netflix shows (ahem la casa de papel) since hbl started and since mid years are cancelled and homework‚Äôs all submitted online, ive been extremely unmotivated to study and super unproductive

i studied reallllllly hard in sec3 and went into sec4 thinking ‚Äúokay last year of mugging, lets get this done and over with‚Äù and now? i study for 30mins straight and alrdy wna die. (im the type to mug like hell so its quite normal to study for long periods without burning out) i used to go to starbucks (almost every other day) to study and now cos of covid, i cant go out to study. my productivity levels shoot up in starbucks, and without that environment, i cant be productive :(

i did well in sec3 so i thought id bring that studying method to sec4 but oh well. i got 6 pts for l1r5 for mid years and 10 pts for eoys, and got top 25% in school, which im quite proud of, due to the fact that ive never achieved that since ive entered my sec sch (its one of the top schs) . for sec4s, we dont have any tests at all for term1, so now with the cancellation of midyears, im afraid i dont know where i stand, and how much ive improved (or maybe the other way round). i only have prelims before the big Os, only one practice. im afraid of fucking up.

also in sec3, all my subjects grades have always been really stable and constant (ranging from B3-A1), except pure chem and chinese. chinese isnt a problem now since i got b3 for CL in Os, but im scared of failing HCL. i dont vibe with taking chinese in jc yk :/ chem has always been my weakest subject since the start of sec3. the only topic i can confidently do is mole concept. ive tried asking for help from my classmates and spamming tys test papers and assessments but i cant seem to do well (or confidently) for chem. sec3, my results were: C6 (t1), C5 (t2), D7 (t3) and suddenly B3 for eoys. it was a miracle idk how that happened but im not complaining. i just binge watched crash courses for chem on youtube and dare i say, barely studied the night before 

i grasp concepts q well for chem and know my content so i score for those copy and paste type of qns but application and the ‚Äúthinking out of the box‚Äù qns always pull me down. my bio teacher (who‚Äôs also a chem tcher for sec1 and 2) told me to do error analysis and identify the type of qns that usually come out (same format etc etc) but i havent done that and ever since the start of this year, i feel like giving up on chem (which isnt an option since i def want to take the sci route in jc) so i rly need help and advice. how do i improve my chemistry?? how to motivate myself (without caffeine rush)?? and if any kind soul wants to send some chem notes over please do, ill be eternally grateful for u :‚Äù)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g0mv6a/o_level_really_unmotivated_need_help_for_certain/,8,"[""hello ! did O's in 2018 \n\ntook eng, e math, a math, pure chem, combi phy bio , chi , history and social studies\n\nfirst off, well done! top 25% of your school is an incredible feat, even if its one of the top schools \n\nyou could :\n\n[ set a schedule ]\n(for studying , taking breaks, getting sufficient break time so you don't go haywire)\n\n- this will also help towards prelims and O's period since you can't be studying at random hours and long periods of time with so much content\n\n[ if you really need the caffine rush, do get it ]\n(but tone it down bit by bit, until you can work without it)\n\n[ 'can't be productive without Starbucks environment'  ]\n\n- could try replicating the environment (well ofc your home is definitely cleaner and much quieter) so find other ways you can become productive as an alternative ¬ø\n\n[ big fear of fucking up' ]\n\n- honestly who isn't? with the term tests and MYE cancelled there's no way for you to gauge where you stand (class and school position aren't relevant anw)\n\n- you can use TYS or request for previous years MYE papers to do (get them to email you or smth) so you can print it out, complete them (using the same way MYEs are held) and grade them yourself \n(I get real scared when my grades from TYS are like C5s, C6s)\n\nfor the part where OP is stressing out on chem\n\n[ error analysis and finding a pattern is pointless ]\n\n- Cambridge can screw you over any minute if something not what you thought comes out then you'll be flustered and brain block  (do check back with your corrections though to see what you could have done better)\n\n[ 'thinking out of the box qns that always pull me down' ]\n\n- why does it pull you down? there is a reason to why these questions seem to impact you the most....\n\n- one way to improve is maybe figuring out which part of the question requires you to think out of the box ; concepts are still the same , just the situation is different (multiple ways to solve the same problem)\n\n> chemistry to me is understanding why certain things work and why some don't , and the processes that are required to get the end product (practicals)\n\nOP,  HBL is a period for students to exercise self-discipline ; you are responsible for your own learning\n\nAll the best !! hoping you do well for O's and make your school and your family proud :)\n\nmy L1R5 was 17, L1R4 13, ELR2B2 13\n\nedit : i was over complacent for my sec 4 MYE and did real bad, don't be like me :( \ntry your best in any and every situation"", 'Sorry I can‚Äôt help you with chem since I didn‚Äôt do well for chem in sch, but I think I know why you are unproductive.

But idk what to do from now. Im so lost, i feel like i am floating. any help is truly appreciated. thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g0gzkp/o_levels_gain_motivation_goal_setting/,8,"['Hello! I rly hope things get better for you soon! Just my thoughts, not sure if it‚Äôll be of much help:\n\nbg info(skip if you want) : I used to feel very unmotivated, and slept all my weekends away. Even on weekdays, I had serious phone addiction and would use it until 2am everyday. I was so unmotivated and stressed. However, I decided to do some research online about effective tips and here‚Äôs what I gathered and used: (I ended up getting nett 5 for o‚Äôs (not the best but decent I guess) so these worked for me, not sure whether it works for you but you can give it a try) \n\nStep 1. Jc goal setting:\n\nDo some research on the various JCs choices. For me, I decided to set my goal back in July last year during DSA period(?) (can‚Äôt rly recall). I was really interested in my current JC‚Äôs flexible subject combination offers (and a special subject that is not offered in most JCs) And also the location matters! Try not to choose a JC that requires you to travel for more than 1h, unless you can tell yourself that it‚Äôs either worth it or you can fully utilise the travelling time for productivity. Also, you can check out the different AMAs threads on this reddit, to see what the current/graduates students think of the JC! Or, if you are particularly interested in a CCA, you can use this as a gage of whether you‚Äôre more interested in which school. Are you more of a humans oriented or science oriented student? You can check out the various COPS for the different streams. For me, I was interested in both so I took a hybrid combi. My goal was overly ambitious, the COP was half of my prelims results, but this overly-ambitious goal of mine served as extra motivation. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt pass the DSA for my dream school and felt really disappointed for the longest time, it felt like there was no other route for me to go into that particular JC, but after much hard work, I made it via JAE.\n\nGoal setting imo is very important because whenever I doubted myself, whether all this hard work was truly worth it, I just kept reminding myself that I have a goal I want to work towards and nothing will stop me.\n\nStep 2: Maximising productivity:\n\n- Schedule: For weaker subjects, allocate two days of the week to review the past knowledge for it! For stronger subjects, you can consider reviewing 2 subjects per day\n\n- Overcoming the curve of forgetting: If you are one who cannot remember certain knowledge (esp for sciences) after a certain time, try looking for the template to overcome the curve of forgetting (Spaced repetition to minimise memory loss?) There are tons of resources online for you to effectively allocate your time for each topic.\n\n- Take breaks! You can always study for 50 mins and take a 10 mins break. Please use this 10 minutes for something relaxing and not addictive (eg scrolling through Instagram) You can maybe do some stretching in between study sessions. Try not to put your brain under stressful conditions for too long without a proper break :-)\n\n- Managing distractions! My smartphone was a major distraction for me, I end up scrolling through memes with my work undone, for hoursss. Therefore, whenever I study, I keep my phone in the drawer (Out of sight, out of reach) However, if I want some bg music (Lo-fi, classical music) I will turn off my wifi and play it HAHAH. But again, pleeeasse put it far away. You can talk to your friends after concentrating on getting your todo list done.\n\n- Set small goals! Small goals can offer small encouragements, for example, if you‚Äôve been consistently failing chemistry (like me HAHA), you can aim to borderline pass next time! And just pace yourself to the end-point of sec sch! (o levels) You will get there one day.\n\n- Tuition! If you are someone who is very very very behind the class pace, it is always best to look for help outside if you cannot come. For me, I attended tuition for math and improved from an F9 in lower sec to A1 in upper sec. It definitely helps, but try not to over-do it if not you may become over-reliant on it. There are a lot of student tutors on Reddit SGEXAMS that are here to help:-)\n\n- Take care of your mental health! A healthy amount of stress is okay, but please do not stress yourself too much! We all need a positive mentality to be 100% focused on what we want to achieve, imo. If you happen to run into issues that is affecting you, please go to your school councillor or a therapist outside.\n\n- TYS! I finished the whole chemistry TYS in two weeks, it was a crazy journey. Please don‚Äôt leave it to last minute like me. Consistently pace yourself in completing the TYS. Cambridge likes to set similar questions (for biology), so spamming TYS will definitely be of some help.\n\n- Please, while you mug, don‚Äôt neglect your life outside of mugging too. It‚Äôs important to achieve balance in everything.\n\n- Duration? Does it matter? I see acquaintances who study for 10 hours a day and others who study for 2 hours a day. Duration doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is what you get out of the hours you spend working hard. Different people have different paces, find one that suits you.\n\n- Get sufficient sleep! Sleep is important for us to function well. Try to get at least 7 hours a day, and take power naps (5mins) throughout the day if you find yourself dozing off while revising\n\n- Do your work beforehand. Don‚Äôt wait for the deadline like me. It‚Äôs always better to read ahead of class so you can ask better questions in class and not leave everything for consultation. For math, I study everything beforehand so lessons serve as further reinforcement of techniques and knowledge. I find this very effective in my learning.\n\nSorry if this was a little long and off-topic! You can always ask me for help, and I will try my best to answer. I took Pure chem, Pure bio, HCL, CL, Pure lit, Elect hist+social studies, Amath, Emath, English lang for o levels! My chem rly sucks so I cant give you tips. My other subjects are still q ok! I‚Äôll try my best!\n\nThis whole reply is entirely based off my opinion. It is important to adjust other‚Äôs habits to find the best for yourself! Not everything works for everyone.\n\nGOOD LUCK, the remaining months of the year will be tough, but it‚Äôs your last lap before O‚Äôs! üòÉüôåüôè \n\nsorry if there are any grammar errors here, my brain is sleeping already üëÄ', ""Hi! I'm sorry you feel this way. \n\nI think that to gain back the motivation you've lost, you can think of the reasons why you want to go to jc. Is it because there are subjects there that interest you? Or a particular jc offers a cca that you enjoy? They don't need to be very strong reasons, but you can come up with a list of reasons about why going to a jc will make you happy, and then work towards it, because in the end, after secondary school, you should go where you think will make you feel the most comfortable and in a positive environment, and if you believe jc is definitely the best place for you, then the list should encourage you :)\n\nI think that HBL is also a toll, and it gets really tiring to look at screens all day, so it's important that you get enough rest and won't feel too tired or drained the next day. Maybe get 7 to 8 hours of sleep regularly, and this will give you the energy to do the stuff you want to do the next day? I know it's really hard to find time to sleep but it's important to keep healthy because I've found that being well rested can really put me in a positive mindset :> \n\nIf you have trouble getting things done, you can try to keep a book and write done all the things you want to finish daily, such as tasks and homework, and once you finish it for the day, you can give yourself a break, watch TV or listen to music. Break your work schedule into parts, so for example you can give yourself a 10 minute break after spending 45 minutes revising notes. This way you won't feel like the amount of work is overwhelming. \n\nYou can also try talking to your family members about how you feel, or your friends :> I'm sure they would lend a listening ear and give you advice \nI hope this helps and feel free to dm me if you want to talk, okay? I took the Os last year and I've discovered these tips to motivate me and I hope that they can help you too üòä"", 'Thank you so much!', 'Thank you!!!!']","[1586784293.0, 1586778157.0, 1586790452.0, 1586779073.0]","[4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0]"

[Poly] how to motivate myself to focus on studies,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1586773808.0,"Entering year 2 next week, and really regret screwing up y1s1. I completely fooled around and got a 2.25 gpa and ended up failing a communications module (of all modules!). 
Learnt my lesson and studied hard in sem 2, did better (3.5 gpa) but my sem 1 pulled down my cumulative by a lot (2.92). 

Now in y2s1, I have to lag one semester behind just to complete the module I screwed up in sem 1 while all my classmates will be 6 months ahead. I'll be joining random classes every module and I'm really worrying about how I can make friends without seeming try-hard/know-it-all/cannot make it. more importantly, i need to be included in projects for the sake of my grades. Plus, I'm kinda sad that I won't even have a graduation ceremony because I'll graduate one semester after my batch. I'm actually classless starting October this year because I'll be thrown into whatever class has the module I need to catch up on and I won't have any classes with my current class (since they're one sem ahead).

Can't help overthinking and worrying about being ostracised and excluded by juniors/batchmates in presentations and projects. It's really getting my mood down and I'm really afraid I'll just give up on studying because I'm rather introverted and working with new people every semester will be a huge challenge. I aim to graduate with at least a cumulative of 3.5 to stand a good chance for uni (bc I'm intending to pursue nursing), and being this outside of my comfort zone 24/7 is not helping.

I'm just really fearful of anything standing in my way of my dream, and right now this hurdle makes it seem like I could expect being looked at like an outsider who suddenly joined their class (which is understandable). Not being able to work well with new group mates anywhere = gpa plummeting, or worse, if I meet people who don't care and are there to free load. How am I supposed to take charge of a team that barely know me, and I barely know them? Its just not possible, and I'm likely to be met with even more resistance. I'll just have to accept a fair grade. It's really not easy to deal with new faces, personalities and uncertainties to work with everywhere I go. 

Being a massive over-thinker, it's not easy to just tell myself, ""don't think so much about it and ride it out"", especially because I was bullied and excluded back in secondary school which completely scarred me and made me permanently traumatised of meeting new people and social situations in general, because I automatically assume the worst possible scenario. And this social anxiety just quadrupled knowing that I'll have to go through this 6-7 times every six months. 

I really can't help but think I'm going to focus on the wrong things (this) for the next 2.5 years instead of focusing on my studies = my dream can't be fulfilled at the end of the day. I may seem really gpa-oriented, but the reality is, I need a good gpa to fulfil my dreams. But there seems to be a lot more than just working hard to get there that's in my way.

Any tips welcome :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g0geqw/poly_how_to_motivate_myself_to_focus_on_studies/,16,"[""It's already a good sign that you recognized the reasons why you didn't do as well in Y1S1 and spent time in Y1S2 to work on it so keep that part up. It will be an uphill battle to pull your GPA up and the room for error is very small, so make every effort count.\n\nKeep an open mind and do your best to build good relationships with your groupmates/coursemates. Instead of dreading the interactions with them, think of it as an opportunity to meet new people and develop your social skills. While it is natural to be a little more wary to interact with others as an introvert, once you take the first step, things will naturally fall into place so don't count yourself out!\n\nAll the best!"", 'Dude if u ever think you are 1 sem behind, I‚Äôm 4 years behind my peers.

If you're the majority gender in your course, that gives you a better safety net, too.

If you can show that you can be diligent and discipline, heck you may even be a valuable asset to some company. So I hope you can see this as a motivation to make the 180degree change and see the value of being hardworking and disciplined.  \n\n\nAnother perspective is how no one cares what secondary school you came from.

I was there in your shoes, but unlike you who was a semester different from your juniors, I was 6 years older than them. I\'m 24 this year and like you, I\'m going Y2S1 next semester. Let me share my story.\n\nI went to JC after Sec 4, retained and like you was not looking forward to be in class with people younger than me. I couldn\'t take the stress of being in a class full of people younger than me, that I subsequently dropped out of JC, despite the efforts of my parents and principal persuading me to stay . I was very egoistic and tried to take GCE A Levels by self-studying which was extremely difficult, and I proved to have not been able to overcome this challenge as well, and I wasted 2 years doing it.\n\nBy then I was still so stubborn and refused to give up and I thought about doing A levels in NS, so I enlisted. Only to find out, it was too tiring and I did not have the physical capability to even finish a single lecture throughout my entire 2 years.\n\nOnce I ORDed, I was 22, as I look at my secondary school and JC peers of my same age as they were entering their 2nd/3rd year in university. I have wasted 6 years of my life because of the fact that I couldn\'t brace myself to endure the inner struggles of me having to live with a class a year younger than me. And being a semi-introvert myself (like you), I kept avoiding social interaction. Now being 23, I took a leap of faith and went into NP, making some of the best classmates I have ever had who are 6 years younger than me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point I\'m trying to make is that, no one really cares if you are a year older or a year younger in Poly or JC. Nobody\'s gonna like come to you and say like ""damm you\'re a year older than me nah im gonna avoid you"". NO ONE cares if you\'re a year older or 6 years older in poly. As long as you are willing to open up and be approachable, YOU WILL MAKE FRIENDS.  I could never accept this very fact and that is why I have wasted 6 years of my life. Occasionally, they do joke about my age, but once you are close to them, you know they are making this joke BECAUSE they are close to you. Furthermore, there are people from Higher NITEC and JC dropouts like me who will definitely have the exact same thought as you did and as I did. So you are not alone. As long as you don\'t care about the age difference, no one else will. If they do, then you should be avoiding them anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Comms, I did quite well for it so I can give you some tips! Honestly, you can ignore everything in the slides like how to do a report and stuff. (But try not to la.) THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN COMMS IS THE MARKING RUBRICS. It is the single-handed piece of page that got me my A. It is a literal checklist that tells you what to include. AND IF YOU HAVE THAT THING INSIDE, its impossible to NOT GET A. Its really impossible. That is for like Assessment 1a, 1b (those written ones). As for presentation skills, I can\'t help much but practising with my group mates helped me a lot!! So ya im just gonna put this out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.2 to 3.5 is a HUGE jump already. Your results already reflect that you are improving greatly and you WANT to make a change in going uni.

Being in nursing, ive met many many people from all ages (people in their 50s even) and nursing has always been a really inclusive space for any age. If I go down to a y1 class from y2, it\'s not so much about the age, but more of worrying about, am I gonna be ostracised for failing. I am practically an outsider in their eyes, like a plus one to normal classes that I shouldn\'t be in.\nAnd it really matters a lot to me, not so much for the sake of my ego or image, but more for the sake of my grades. Because if I am not included in discussions, I\'m not gonna have a good grade at all.\n\nBut wow, really thank you for the kind words. It really means a lot because having Asian parents, when they heard about my gpa, all they told me was ""3.5 no Uni will want you.""

[JC] Road to A Levels (PCM/E),Junior Colleges :karma:,1586768154.0,"I saw that many of you guys post about this and I felt the need to do the same and hopefully inspire some to do work hard and do better than before especially in trying times such as this crisis of coronavirus outbreak.

Back in secondary school, I was a student from a SAP school and the teachers there were really helpful. For O levels though, I did not put in my best effort and ended up with an L1R5 of 13, entering Temasek JC because that was the best and closest school to my house that I could enter with my O level score that includes 4 bonus points.

JC, on the other hand, was a wild ride and definitely a life-changing experience. Of course like many others out there, I started to make friends but I lost them repeatedly, making me go on an emotional roller-coaster. Eating became difficult and it was hard to smile(besides the random jokes that some classmates make in class). It definitely made a toll on my grades in jc1 mya as I couldn't concentrate on any of the subjects(besides math cause it is my favourite). Although we finally reconciled in the end after a good 2 months, I'm still sad that we couldn't be friends like last time because of what happened throughout the term. I was still surprised that my grades were actually really good (as of the first major exam in jc) relative to the class (ABE/SU). I still wanted to build on this friendship that I lost (I told myself that I would give up if that initial level of friendship could not be recovered by the end of the year and I gave up in the end. The friendship is still there, thankfully but we are not as close anymore. Please do not ask about what happened) so I joined the night study programme even though I wasn't part of it. From this friend, I managed to make more friends(in the library! Isn't that ridiculous?!). The 3 of them turned out to be the people that I needed all this time, though one of them sorta strayed away because of lack of common interests while the other went poly because of failing promos.

Thanks to new found friendships, I got back my motivation to study and at the same time help them if they need it for math and chemistry. I relied more on studying in school, spending most of my time in the school library or a public library to study because of how many distractions were at home. I significantly improved my math and chemistry with minor improvements in gp and econs, while suffering a small drop in marks for physics. For promos I may not be ranked as well compared to mya in my class but I was really satisfied with that improvement (ABC/ES) <-- also kinda funny that I get all the grades in my exams.

In jc2, I took up H3 math because I like math a lot. Though it was fun, I dropped it sometime in term 2 cause I felt that it would affect my other subjects that were more crucial to my university admission if I were to spend time studying for it. For interest I continued attending the tutorials and lectures of course and collected those H3 notes for me to to read up after A levels in preparation for uni (I'm accepted into mathematical sciences in ntu fyi).

Now for mct, I wasn't really in the mood to study because of all the fascinating stuff I learnt and stuff that I am going to learn throughout the year. I know I shouldn't be doing that but I couldn't resist it and my mct grades suffered (ABE/UU).

For the rest of term 2, I was still distracted by it and also started to talk more than I study during the night study programme with my friends and my grades continued to drop. Thankfully, I found a good tutor who can teach me gp and econs during the june holidays. She helped me in clarification of content in my econs and also improved my language skills in gp. Also, a side note that I managed to focus better at home, being able to switch slowly to studying at home. From past experiences, I noticed that if I study at home without getting myself distracted, I could be more productive than when studying outside. My content subjects still suffered(even math but I'm thankful that the school rounded up 69.5 to 70 which is an A) but at least my H1's, especially econs have improved significantly (AEE/DSB). <-- that B is for pw because my group didn't do well for written report and so A depends on whether we had an excellent answer for Q&A (which i didn't). 

After mya, I began to study more at home than in school and I seeked help for physics, going for tuition at a tuition centre(really effective in helping me get my content right on the spot). For my other subjects, as I am more familiar with my content, I started doing prelim papers. As my math is strongest among my subjects, I focused more on my other subjects (not as much for chemistry though because the tutors really killed the cohort with a tough paper in mya. The paper wasn't that hard but the tutors just made it such that they are very stingy to give marks, having fewer marks given for a difficult question compared to a standard A level paper), especially physics. I knew that prelims would be a good indicator of how I do for A levels so I put in more effort. Finally, I managed to produce my best set of results in jc (and finally pass gp for the first time!) having another significant improvement for chemistry and econs with slight improvement for math (got careless but still satisfied that I improve considering how little effort I put in) and physics (i wasn't upset although i put in a lot of effort for physics because the paper was a lot tougher than the one in mya). It was also the first time that all my subjects improved (ABD/BEB).

Finally, the last stretch from prelim to A levels. All content is completed but some people wants to take a break. No you do not take a break. You can already see the finishing line so DO NOT STOP! Recap all your content once more and continue doing the practice papers. Here is where I started doing my tys. Yes, it is very late to start but better late than never. Every weekend, I just grind papers after papers, focusing on 1 or 2 subjects a week. This helped me to complete about 3 papers(each subject for eg math have 2 papers and i did 3 which means 1.5 years worth of papers). As the A levels study break started, I grind them even more especially on 2/3 days before the paper itself. Yes, I saved some papers to do when closer to the exam. In the end for paper 2's and 3's for chem and physics, I completed about 5 to 6 years excluding those used as timed practices in school. For math, I only did a few papers to get the momentum going. Do not learn from me on how I study math unless you have a really strong foundation where you can close both eyes and score straight A1's in A math of 85 and above with minimal effort. But if you are really that good in one subject that you can guarantee your A, go ahead and use that extra time to study other weaker subjects. In the end, your results determine your future (well, at least what you do for the next few years anyway) and they are yours to keep for the rest of your life. I was really happy with my results considering that I only started the momentum to study in June and build it up after that all the way to A levels (AAA/ACB).

Just a few tips on how to study:
1. Start early but do not go all out at the start because you don't want to wear out by the end of the year.

2. Build up the rigour in studying your subjects as your exam approaches. Take frequent but short breaks after 45min studying. You can make notes if you like but I find that I do not have enough time to make them.

3. When doing practice papers, do it under timed conditions. If you exceed the time, complete the paper first and take note how much you exceeded. Work on cutting down the time taken to complete your paper.

4. Seek help from your tutors as soon as you need to clarify something. Ask during or after your tutorials. Book consults with them as well when you need a full 25 or 50min block to cover misconceptions and/or exam strategies.

5. You can ask me, maybe I can help you though I'm sorta rusty already.

6. Try your best not to be affected by external factors like me in jc1(also, please do not ask what happened) . Solve them asap or else look for your school counsellor. I was only lucky that I wasn't affected that much thanks to my strong foundation in math and chemistry(thanks to taking chem olympiad training in sec 4, barely passing chem mya in jc1)

[Uni] Conversations with NUS MSE representative,University :snoo_smile:,1586767645.0,"Just thought posting this might help some people who are also interested in materials science and engineeeing.  Am currently serving NS and got accepted into NUS and NTU MSE.  Just had a conversation with someone from NUS MSE department, and here are some insights which she provided:

Question: What's the key difference between NUS MSE vs NTU MSE?

Response:
- curriculum largely similar
- NUS has smaller class size, allow for more personalised interactions with profs, seniors and batchmates.  Profs can give advice to students, and you get to know more seniors who have since graduated and started working for a company.

Question: what are the most common job prospects for material engineering graduates?

Response:
- Materials engineering allows graduates to enter into diverse industries.  E.g. pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding (corrosion science), etc.
- Develop materials with certain properties for companies

Question: is postgraduate studies important to enter into the field?

Response:
- depends on your job scope.  Many industrial jobs is better to go for internship with hands on experience than further education
- but if enter into research, need further education.

Question: can you choose to drop a second major/minor?

Response:
-yes, before graduation if u have not completed enough modular credits to graduate with the second major/minor, u have two options:
1. To drop the major/minor and jusy graduate with your main major
2. Extend your studies to complete the modular credits

[A Levels] H1 / H2 History tips,A Levels :snoo:,1586758913.0,"Wanted to share some tips for those still trying to grapple with the heavy history syllabus! Got an A for h2 history (2019 A levels. yes. the paper that didn‚Äôt test any AFC question) despite hovering around Ds and Cs for my entire h2 history journey. 

1. tables are your best friends. 
i like to compile my notes in tables. it helps me compare how each country reacted to the issue and what policy they implemented. very helpful for case study essays, like UN or SEA. for more, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zgNCsB91vf4hZuKCsi8iYVlLg5wbRw7fV9IPMPQYVO8/edit?usp=sharing

2. timelines.
you MUST do timelines for sbcs topics! if not, you‚Äôll get lost in the sea of dates and will be unable to pick out the dates quickly for contextualisation. 

3. steal notes from other schools.
i was from TJ, and one of the notes that they provided me with was a vv thick booklet which narrated the decol-pol stab era of each SEA state WITHOUT ANY BULLET POINTS. if you're presented with notes like these, you have to force yourself to sit down and start highlighting and colour-coding, e.g. pink for policy, orange for impact, yellow for reaction. OR, if you find that you're running out of time (you shouldnt be btw, running out of time means youre still doing this during the prelim-As block study period), PLEASE USE UR FRIENDSHIP AND CONNECTIONS FROM OTHER SCHOOLS TO GET THEIR HISTORY NOTES. some schools with good notes include: HCI, EJC, RJC, VJC. I mainly used HCI (their notes are vv detailed, could give you more knowledge to gain an advantage in the bell curve) and EJC (the teacher authors it in a way which seems like he's talking to you. very nice)

4. practice!
sooner or later your school will start to photocopy other schools' exam papers for you, during the prelim-As block study period. please start practicing BEFORE THIS PERIOD. you can hunt around in your school's library for past history papers. do them. consult your teacher. force your teacher to mark it

5. how to practice?
this is merely a suggestion. i got myself together after mid years, sat down and started practicing. however, it was a bit late for me to start writing out full answers and asking my teacher to correct them. instead, i analysed every source and wrote them down on a piece of paper in bullet points, e.g. purpose, context (contextualise), is it reliable/true (cross refer to other sources and/or context). this is v useful for part (b) questions. for part A, i just like to highlight the similar and different quotes directly on the source and write their explanation in bullet points too. for essays, just plan your stand (intro), topic sentences and conclusion. make sure you have at least two examples under each topic sentence, especially those with case studies (UN and SEA).

6. the paper.
disclaimer: my writing speed is above average.

sbq: 10 min - look at sources
part (b) (always did part b first, but pls find out whats best for u) - 45 min
part (a) - 15-20min

essay: 5 min for each essay plan; 45 min per essay

5min remaining = buffer time

hope this helps, all the best!

Of course, hall/rc isn't the only way to make friends but I would say that it's the best/easiest way to make friends. Another good way to make friends is through Orientation Camps but given the Covid-19 situation, there won't be any Orientation Camps so it's kinda unfortunate. Also, in University, you'll always see a different bunch of people due to no fixed class, unless you do sign up for the same tutorial slot as your friends. As such, most friends you make will tend to be hi-bye unless ya'll hang out and it has to be 2-sided.

I think it might be an area of interest for me, and I want to find out more about it!\n\nIntellectual property law is about striking a balance between protecting what people create (thus giving them an incentive to innovate) and the public good (ensuring that the creations are eventually made available for the public to use). All IP laws try to provide enough protection for people to innovate without over or under protecting their creations. But because since there are different types of creations, they are subject to different kinds of rules which aim to strike the balance in different ways: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYiXTKbdNr4\n\nThis is a pretty decent intro to the kind of work IP lawyers do: https://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/practice-areas/intellectual-property\n\nAnd this is a fun (hopefully) and accessible video on copyright law and youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QU\n\nMy perspective is that this is a really exciting time to be studying IP.  So much of the world is related to IP and studying IP really changes how you look at the things you interact with. It's one of those areas which has so many possible applications that there's something for everyone. Art, pharmaceuticals, software, publishing, brand management, telecommunications, broadcasting are just a few examples. There are a lot of new and exciting problems to deal with, especially with new technology.\n\nStudying IP was great. I **love** the IP prof. Despite the fact that IP has very few clear answers (many things are a matter of impression and it's quite common for judges to have completely opposite conclusions on the same subject matter), she is incredibly clear and structured. She really breaks things down in a way that makes it easy to understand. Her class is probably one of the most oversubbed electives in lawsku because she's really good and because it's a relatively light 8 credit mod.\n\nAs something to pursue in the long term, it's a somewhat specialised practice area because of the content barrier to entry (there's **a lot** to learn) and because the facts that IP tends to be applied to can be intimidating (patents are obviously a bit inaccessible if the last time you did science was PSLE, but things like software copyright can be difficult to wrap your head around if you don't understand computers). But not everyone handles that kind of thing. \n\nIf you have more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them."", "">In fact they've been trying to sell a law degree as one that can open doors outside the legal industry.\n\nThat being said, that's more to assuade you to pursue law in the event you are not 100% certain about pursuing a legal career.

last month i was still certain that if all 3 give me offers i will go by NUS>NTU>SMU (provided that they give me biz/acc) but now since NUS is out and the more research i do online, the more idk how to chose btw NTU and SMU...

what are attractive about NTU are the 3-years, direct honor, its fame internationally, hall life (appealing but not that impt), greater alumni network, but the starting pay is the lowest among 3 uni? (for biz)

while SMU prepares u for the workforce, the higher starting pay, no need to live outside (save costs), very good career office? (as compared to the NTU?), more flexible timetable/combi, but it has some intimidating parts like 20% of class participation? (i want to challenge myself but 20% still quite intense for acc?), super competitive environment, hard to make genuine friends, and if u don't have ur clique u will lose out during bidding? and many complained that the presentations and quizzes increase the workload (at least in comparison with NTU).

And is it really that local employers prefer SMU graduates? how do MNCs view SMU?

i am interested in banking/finance, i also like both biz and acc (only by judging from the curriculum, i also dk if i will really like it when i study), but my igp is not high cannot allow me to apply for ddp, thats why i didn't

1) I know both if these majors ( psych and science ) are really content-heavy modules so could someone input on how hard is it to cope if i were to be able to secure a spot?

2) If i am unable to get a second major in NUS and only managed to get a single major how would i go about declaring a second major/minor from another school? (like if im from FASS but i want to have a second major in school of biological science)

3) How would the summer programme work if i am planning to spend a semester overseas? Since there will be certain locations/schools for certain majors (i think?)

4) What if i am hopping to work in a lab (research) in future is it possible? Like i do something not related to psych but mainly from my second major/minor?

[Uni] SUTD VS NUS Information Systems (Need Advice),University :snoo_smile:,1586712970.0,"Hey seniors and fellow redditors. I have a tough decision to make but am unsure of what is the better choice. I am offered Information Systems in NUS together with a Merit scholarship for now. On the other hand SUTD offered me admission into Information Systems and a STEP scholarship.

If you were me, what would you choose?

One thing really bothering me is that school starts way earlier for sutd as compared to other universities that make me quite anxious about deciding.

Most uniquely, SUTD has engineering/design/projects interwoven smoothly in the curriculum and have many more points (U can pm me i will share with u a lot) that is unique to SUTD and not found in NUS.

SUTD is a niche school in STEM similar to SMU in business and see how far SMU has come. I have friends choosing SUTD over NUS Cs precisely because of SUTD unique pedagogy.

[A LEVELS] I NEED NEED HELP TO STOP PROCRASTINATING,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1586710891.0,"Hi I'm currently a J1 student in JPJC. Just a little background. I got like 18 raw and 14 nett and got in. I have been procrastinating so damn bad since JC started. And it has gotten even worse during this HBL period. I'm not submitting my homeworks. I haven't even touched some of my work that was supposed to be completed during the Match Holidays and I'm falling badly behind my class. I'm just so addicted to my phone, watching memes, playing games, using social media, watching YouTube and stuff. My teachers told me to try to come up with a checklist and cross something everytime I've done something but it doesn't seem to working for me at all. My teachers keep asking my where's my work that I was supposed to scan and upload to the respective Google drives. I just tell them that I have no idea how to do it and or I just simply ignore their PMs. I feel extremely guilty about lying like that because they believe that I'm actually trying my best when I'm actually not and they trust my stupid ass lies. It hurts to lie to someone whom you know trusts you. I keep procrastinating and pushing everything to the end. I feel like I am falling behind all of my classmates. They are diligently answering questions and doing their work. And I feel like I don't deserve to be in such a place. I want to change but I don't know how to stop it all. I wouldn't mind giving my phone to parents but I'm always constantly scared that they'll check the stuff in my phone. Can someone tell me or give me an actual effective way to stop this procrastination and how to bounce back?


P.S. My sleep schedule is f-ed up as well. I can't sleep till like 3am and I wake up at like 10-11am
Sometimes I sleep in the afternoon too. My life has been a fricking mess for as long as I can remember. People keep saying I look like a hard worker because I have been having horrible eye bags since Sec 1. But the truth is now I don't really work hard anymore. I want to but I don't know how to get it into action",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g00dta/a_levels_i_need_need_help_to_stop_procrastinating/,20,"[""Heyy. I dont know how much this would help you but since I'm awake so might as try. I wouldn't consider myself as a mugger even till the actual examination. I would sleep the entire day after an examination and wake up at 3am to study the next day. But I had it relatively manageable because I was consistent in my studies. In j1, even though I did not perform as well, I made sure that I at least attempted all my tutorials. Don't make your life tough for yourself next year. Start today. Here are my advice:\n1. Sleep well. Go to sleep!!! Nvr nvr stay up beyond 12am when it's the school term. It does not only affect you the next day. It deteriorates your brain for the next few days (personal experience). If you're stressed, sleep well and early tonight and wake up early the next day. 5am etc. You'll be refreshed and have more hours to grind through your work.\n2. I'm not a checklist person as well. If it doesn't work, you can just try other methods. For me, I didn't even write down what I need to do. It was just going with the flow for me.\n3. From what I read, you may fallen into a vicious cycle of avoiding pressure and gaining more as a result. Don't panic first. Move forward. Forget about the homework in March. Do the ones now. Ask your parents to help you keep your phone for the day. On your computer, do not even attempt to open any tabs regarding social media. If you are doing your work, I would suggest you to take all your electronics out of the room you are working with. I understand the urge to look at your cellphone here and there. For me, I overcame it with other actions. I would snack or get myself something to fidget with. Its weird but I think it's part of the subconscious. You are going to be busy with another action that you would be able to get rid of the urge to play with your phone.\n4. It's totally okay to be lazy now and not do work on time. It's pretty common, but don't ever sleep late. It will mess your body up so much. Even if you don't do any work, sit through the lessons and just ask questions. You'll learn somehow. \n\nOkay, I'm gg to sleep now. I'm sleeping late bc I have no school ya but you shouldn't."", 'Ngl, I was exactly the same as you. I wasted my J1 procrastinating and neglected my hmwk, always having the (got tmr to do mentality). Everytime I try to do hmwk, I will lose focus and start to use social-media, play games etc. This kinda mentality was also encouraged by my classmates who would joke about mugging and make it seem like studying is a bad thing.\nProcrastinated all the way until J2 and I finally had to pull my socks up and start ACTUALLY studying because MYE was coming up. \n\nI really hope that you don‚Äôt make the same mistake as me. For me, what really got me to actually start studying, is really just me panicking and realising a major exam is coming up lmao. My daily routine would usually be: go back home after schl, procrastinate until dinner, do the bare minimum for the next day, then play somemore. That kinda changed when I started going to the school library to study with my friends. They were a bunch of really chill people who study after school and go back home before dinner time, taking short breaks in between. Studying with them strangely made me feel a kinda peer pressure to study, like looking at them study made me feel like I‚Äôll loose out if I don‚Äôt study with them. And of course, when I study, I‚Äôll listen to pop music (yes pop music, but it has to be not too loud or I‚Äôll loose focus). \n\nSo I just typed out my grandmother story but in a nutshell... \n1. Find good company. Since it‚Äôs lockdown obviously u don‚Äôt go out and study with your friends. You can study with a sibling, FaceTime/Skype your friend and study with them. For me, I can‚Äôt do things alone, so having good company always helps.\n2. Get a good environment. Try to minimise distractions. For me, the phone was a huge distraction but somehow, listening to music with headphones on would make it like uh, sort of a smaller distraction that is still distracting me but not as much so I can still focus a good amount on studying? Sounds weird, idk how to phrase it.\n3. Get a good momentum. Don‚Äôt expect yourself to suddenly be able to study 24/7. Set breaks for yourself. Don‚Äôt actually study till you drop, the moment you get tired of studying, you won‚Äôt feel like studying anymore, and you will auto fall back to procrastinating again. Once u get a good momentum going, you can progressively increase  your study time, till you can study for slightly longer hours while staying focus.\n\nHope you find this message meaningful. \n(Typing this whole message out at 1am so idk if I‚Äôm making sense but if anything u dun understand, just ask)', ""Alright. Here are some tips that I think may help:\n\n1) Change your environment. If you have your own room, put distractions out of sight. Your discipline needs work now and if you can't fight the urge, you need to make sure the urge doesn't even surface. 9ut of sight, out of mind. Delete social media. If you want to use it, install it and uninstall again, or tuck it away in folder and make it hard to get to. Better yet, put the phone away. \n\nOn the other hand, keep your books on hand and put essential links and apps on your desktop or bookmarks. It'll remind you of the priorities that you need to keep up on. Keep your notes and books organised, it'll make it easier to get back into the flow of things. Even if you don't want to clean, just do it while you're looking for your necessary notes. \n\n2) Do 1%. Anything is better than nothing. Sometimes everything is too daunting, so just do a little. Even if you put in 1%, by the end of 30 days, you'll be 30 times better than you were before, and the homework won't accumulate as much. On the other hand, if you fall behind, the homework will become an insurmountable mountain. Even if you don't feel like it, do the bare minimum, because it's better than nothing. \n\nSometimes doing the bare minimum helps to gain momentum (because you'll get over the barrier of starting to begin with) and encourages you to do more. \n\n3) Plan your day (preferably day before). It makes sure you know what to do before you even start, and makes the whole process run smoother. Sometimes you can predict distractions before they occur, so you can mentally prep yourself to avoid them, and verbalise the consequences of your actions. \n\n4) Pomodoro Technique. This is a famous one. Work for 25 minute and then have a 5 minute break. For every 2 hours, you can get a 30 minute break and maybe watch one episode of Netflix or something. You can modify the timing, but generally it helps because you have a break to look forward to.\n\n--\n\nFor sleep, do a bedtime ritual or something (like read a book or relaxation, or just keep the light low) so it preps you for sleep. Keep the phone away. I know, it's hard, but the blue light keeps you awake, so put it down at least 30 minutes before your bed time.\n\nIf you can't sleep, just get out and study or read. Don't stay in bed, because your brain will associate your bed with the absence of sleep. Heck, sometimes threatening yourself to study if you can't sleep can help you get to sleep faster.\n\nI also read that exercise can help to sleep better, but maybe avoid doing it too close to night time.\n\nSleep is the battery for your existence, and honestly makes the whole process of studying and staying focused so much easier. Try to work on this as soon as possible. \n\nHope it helps."", ""Hey I totally understand you. Sometimes I feel like I concentrate and work better under peer pressure. So I think your first one would work out for me. And the second one, not really sure if I can do it because my parents keep nagging me not to listen to music while studying cause it is not good and blah blah and it annoys me and I end up rebelling and fall into procrastination once again. I used to listen to music and work too and I did work more productively without music actually so I get what you mean. You tend to touch and use your phone a lot when it's beside you but when you're listening to music, you don't really have that feeling much(unless you wanna change the song).

[Uni] NUS or NTU? (Aeronautical/Aerospace Eng),University :snoo_smile:,1586710886.0,"So I‚Äôve gotten my Uni offer from both NUS (Mechanical Engineering Aeronautical Eng Specialisation) and NTU (Aerospace Eng). I‚Äôm having trouble deciding which offer I should accept. 

From what I searched online...
NTU got higher proportion of graduates who got employed but both starting pay relatively the same. (comparison from NTU and NUS ges)
NTU focuses more on Aerospace Eng but NUS teaches the mechanical eng part for 3 years then last year is the aeronautical part.
I don‚Äôt really know what kinda internship both courses are having but if there is some bomb ass internship opportunity in one of the course do let me know!

From what i read online...
Some people say there really isn‚Äôt really much of a difference since both courses are prestigious. (Don‚Äôt really care about the course prestige)
Someone commented that they would go for the NUS course since the course didn‚Äôt focus entirely on aerospace, you can find jobs in other mechanical eng related sectors.

I don\'t know your subject combo but here\'s the general overview.\n\nLanguages. The key to doing well is Vocabular and Grammar. If your diction is small, read more to learn new words everyday. Start a notebook. Craft a sentence or two with these new words. You won\'t remember them unless you use them. As for grammar, there\'s the easy way and the hard way. The easy way is to read many story books such that you get used to what proper grammar is. The hard way is literally learn the rules, and remembering them.\n\nMaths. Practice practice practice. I can\'t emphasize strongly enough. It\'s like riding a bike, you will get better with practice. But if you don\'t ride for a long time, you\'ll be more wobbly. By now your school should have almost finished the syllabus, or maybe left with vectors/matrices. It will be good to review all the chapters from sec1 till now (or sec 3 for A mathl). To get a gauge, your workbooks have review rests every 3-4 chapters, do all of them to measure where you stand.\n\nSciences. Write notes, compartmentalise the information. Draw links and make them count. After which, try to get your hands on as many other school papers as you can so that you are familiar with all the possible question types and not get stumped with new information during the actual exam. Physics formulae, chemical reactions and biological parts/processes all need to be committed to memory, so make sure you budget enough time to commit them to memory.\n\nHumanities. Like sciences, there are many facts to remember so please do up your notes. However you\'ll need to start practice writing your essays and build up some stamina with writing. Especially for SS and History, write more (at least 2 essays a week) and ask your teachers if they are willing to help you mark. For geography, remember to practice drawing your diagrams too. As for lit, enjoy your book, do character studies and make a notebook to analyse the plot too!\n\nThere\'s about 190days till English paper 1, the ""start"" of the written exams.

[A Level] Self Study tips for H2 Physics for a Polytechnic graduate?,A Levels :snoo:,1586705513.0,"Taking on the A level in NS as a Poly Graduate.

A levels during NS as a Polytechnic Grad.

I am a biomedical science polytechnic graduate and have recently been offered to read Bioengineering at NTU (accepted).

NTU Bioengineering offers a foundation physics module for JC students (who did not study physics at A level) and polytechnic students.

-Background- 
I did not take pure physics at the O level but took physics in polytechnic as an elective (Grade: Distinction).

As I‚Äôll be drafting into national service later this year, I figure that I should sharpen my physics foundation by studying H2 Physics while waiting for enlistment and during NS - in the hopes of taking the A levels as a private candidate the following year (2021) to skip the foundation module. - (just 1 subject).

In the span of 16 months and taking into account NS commitments (uncertainty) - 

How should I approach self studying H2 Physics? -

Do share tips!!

You\'ll be in NS so you don\'t have time for regular sessions. \n\nBut to go it on yourself, \n1. Get a copy of the syllabus\n2. Get notes from 2-3 JCs\n3. Buy past year prelim papers and TYS(topical) to practice\n4. JCs often provide ""revision packages"" which are full of questions sorted by topic. If you\'re lucky, you\'ll find some with the answer key\n5. Do up a study plan so you can pace yourself.\n6.

Notes\n\nFor me, my notes really helped me in my knowledge for content so I think making one might help you too. It's fine if it's not completed now but do try to do it by prelims since that is when everything is tested."", ""Hi there! we might be able to help you with h1 chem as we are going to held a free masterclass. u only have to sign up and you then have a goodie bag which contains chem notes, digital ones. there is also this organic black book which will be sent to you by mail. \n\nthose notes may be of help especially this HBL period because it can become your reference in every chem assignment you have a confusion with. \n\nif you are keen, PM me so I can have you redirected.

I was super disappointed at first and cried really hard, and subsequently I got quite depressed because I thought I worked hard enough for O\'s but still scored badly. Went to YJC and flunked my JC1 mid-year exams getting two U grades because I was super unmotivated.

From YJC', 'Hi I graduated from YJC but I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with IJC either (cuz my sibling was from IJC).\n\nI‚Äôm in Uni now and enjoying my course of study and the Uni curriculum is so much better than A levels.\n\nWanna do a shoutout to all YJC/IJC/YIJC alumni (and current YIJC students) who wanna join in starting an Alumni Working Group\n(not considering an officially registered association yet as I wanna ensure sustainability first; I went to check up on the original YJC and IJC Alumni Associations info on the Registry of Societies and found it poorly maintained)\n\nI‚Äôve contacts with different ppl in industry, education, enrichment programmes and other opportunities. \nHopefully can start some collaboration and maybe even a mentorship programme.\n\nDrop me a DM to discuss more! :)', 'i graduated from YJ about 4-5 years ago. i repeated my j1 year. my time YJ was not gr8 bcos i was struggling with my grades and mental health. but there were teachers who rly would go the extra mile for their students and i made it out of A levels would be because of their extra help. so yeah. i was just glad that i passed my A levels when i got my results. got accepted into NTU. completed my degree, working full time now and a software developer. so i would say, i‚Äôm doing fine. :-)', 'Hi! Graduated from Yjc back in 2017, took PCME and gotten decent results to study Computer science at NUS.\n\nI would say that the mugging sessions were intensive back then and required alot of perseverance and hard work.. for the 2 years.\n\nDoing fine in life right now, working from home and waiting for university to begin üòó.\n\n(COVID-19 boomer here)', ""Hello, similar to [u/FrostSurge](https://www.reddit.com/user/FrostSurge) , was contemplating writing as this will pretty much give away my identity too. I'm not a long time lurker in this sub but I hope to inspire future juniors or graduated YJC/IJC friends to not give up. I graduated from YJC a few years ago, and was one of the few lucky ones to do well enough for A Levels to receive a scholarship from a local University too.\n\nYJC was not my first choice JC (just like everyone) as I stay in the east and travelling there is a real hassle. Most YJC-ian I know back then are all rejects from TPJC, JJC, PJC, SRJC...many of them screwed up their Os, and dislike being in YJC as it was not a school chose for, and I think this is how it contributed to unmotivated students in YJC.\n\nEducation wise, I believe YJC does not push you beyond the limits. I feel like most teachers there are pushing the students to enter local Uni, and have little regard for any extra-curricular academic research activities. Students mainly do rot memorisation and have generally very little understanding, learning the steps to solve and not understanding the crux of the problem. My course in uni now requires a lot of understanding rather than rot memorisation, so actually I'm not doing well in university now. (hope that answers your question!)\n\nI think the solution to succeed in YJC is to be resilient and disciplined. Most of us will have setbacks in life, and we need to learn how to bounce back from this setbacks and try again the next time.I did extremely bad for my prelim even with a lot of hard work, My H2s were EUU and I almost gave up because I didn't think I can jump 5 or 6 grades within a few months. But I just kept working harder, studying 12 hours a day uninterrupted during the month before A-Levels, did all my TYS at least twice, and even after the written papers were over, I was still putting in 12 hour study days for the MCQ papers. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, I managed to score 85 RP, with H2 AAB. When hard work meets opportunity, I guess that is when a miracle happens!\n\nAs for discipline, we need to be disciplined as most students there are probably playing every day, and it would be easy to be sucked into the habit of not doing work, skipping lectures, etc. Always remember to complete your homework on time, consult your teachers, practise and understand the content that was being taught, and follow a proper study schedule. That being said, I actually had a lot of fun hanging out in YJC after class and I've met amazing people during my time.\n\nTL;DR YJC gives you the opportunity to do well for A Levels, though the education might not be the best, seize this chance, be disciplined and always stay resilient. Remember your hobbies and don't burn out!\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that YJC study notes are not great. Tuition center notes are succinct, easy to digest. If you don't have the money to attend tuition class, try obtaining notes from Carousell/Seniors who have already graduated from JC"", ""Hi, from first batch of YIJC students who just graduated last year. I came from a neighbourhood school(with PSLE 198) and tbh I was kinda excited to come to JC...until I realised there are people in the school who were much less excited about going to JC as they want to go to better schools.(including those who have o level points suitable to go JPJC or CJC but kena rejected by the school when transfering)\n\nTo be honest, I have heard of people who want to aim to get 90 rp but was demoralised by PW with most people getting a B. But even with that, the study culture in YI is relatively okay (not the best but not the worse also). The teachers are caring too just don't piss them off!\n\nAt first at J1, I had gotten some Bs and As but after tackling events from 2 CCAs and almost giving up cus of stress, my grades deproved in J2.(the first time I actually saw Us and Ss and no As) Even worse is when I lost my Physics notebook(rip). But I ended up changing my study habits:\n-Doing TYS and past prelim papers\n-Recall definitions and notes by talking to myself.\n-Changing locations sometimes(Community Clubs/School/Khoo Teck Puat Hospital)\n-I did time trials(as recommended by my senior)\n-Listen to lectures or do homework during lecture (relevant to the subject of course like Math and Physics)\n-*Actually ask* for help from friends cus I am not used to talking to teachers.\n\nUltimately, I scored 78rp (ABB) with C for H1 Econs.(still it is an improvement from 40 to 50 rp during Prelims with a U/S in Chem). \nIn NS now and had received an offer from NTU, still waiting for NUS though I suspect they wouldn't considering the competitiveness.\n\nAs said by FrostSurge earlier, the echo chamber actually persists but there are even worse cases where people look down on people mugging for A levels (even though we are J2 students and it is already May.) Heck, I have been mocked for not even having a game in my phone.\n\nMy advise to the juniors in YIJC is to use time wisely. I have seen people playing Mario Kart/Mobile legends in September. I am not saying you should stop playing phone games but if it affects your studies ,not a good idea. Every second counts. It is just how you want to handle it. \n\nAnd for those who can get 70 or 80 rp for prelims, I recommend you guys to at least do some community service. Like seriously, I am not kidding, it can be a very good thing to add into your testimonial and it can be beneficial for Aptitude based admission as they look for community service/relevent work experience as well."", 'From 2018/2019 YIJC batch!\n\nI\'m doing pretty well, just sad that I have no job during this period of time. Anyway, I did do okay for As (77.5) which I still feel I could have done better but I cannot so a little sad about it.\n\nWhat I\'m sad about is honestly my JC friends because for the people I\'m close with, most of them has to retake As so it means I\'m at a different life stage than them / feel this gap in what is happening between us. So I just hope that they will do their best and join me in uni soon!\n\nRegarding the culture of YIJC, I do think it is toxic. I come from a sec school of around 240 so most of the people in my class went to HCI, RJ, VJ etc. Well I screwed up my Os and was rejected from ASR so I was like YI it is. I still remember that J1 I did pretty okay and my friends somewhat did their tutorials but a lot of people were not studying, don\'t know how to study. They called me mugger even though what I did was just doing tutorials early / practising some extra questions that notes sometimes have at the back. My CCA friends would also be like ""aiyah, no need study one"".\n\nAnd I feel the most impactful one for me was when my classmates can forget test dates, even when my teacher had reminded them just yesterday.\n\nAnd this is why I feel PW is particularly hard for YIJC because you meet extremely poor teammates. I was lucky enough for mine that I only had one of them and two others who needed my nagging to do stuff. I still remember that during promo, I was so unmotivated for PW that I just told my teammate who was carrying the project with me that I give up. The person was like ""no, you can\'t do that, I really need you"".\n\nTeachers wise, there are teachers that are suited to teach unmotivated ones, there are teachers who are realistic and say maybe only 1 out of this lecture group and solve this problem, there are teachers who really want to help but can only do so with consultations that people don\'t go for.\n\nOh, and then you have absentees that don\'t turn up from May onwards because they want to self study. I can see why but I honestly feel that most aren\'t self disciplined enough to do so, thus the choice is really up to the students.\n\nNotes wise, I actually feel that they are pretty okay, I never had the thought of asking my friends from other JCs to lend me their notes to look through. I just do my one notes based on YIJC ones and yeah. Maybe I should have since maybe because I didn\'t and that\'s why there is no comparison and that YIJC ones are good enough for me.\n\nI do face this issue where there are absentees so all this notes get stuffed in the lockers, and they don\'t ever retrieve them. Seriously, by like June if your class is like mine, your class locker will be filled and you just use lockers from other classes\n\nResources wise like practice papers, YIJC has this system where you compile the number of students who want the papers, pay the auntie accordingly and done. This means that there are people who don\'t buy them since they don\'t think it will benefit them.\n\nAdvice for juniors, I would say complete your tutorials, consult your teachers as early as possible (this is based on how my class was like). Better advice, look through this Reddit to find them.', 'oh how i wish this thread came out 2 years ago when i first entered YI. it would have given me a lot more hope and motivation', '[deleted]', 'Hi I am from the IJC batch 2015 and I didn‚Äôt really do so well for A‚Äôs tho although I managed to enter NTU. I think it‚Äôs important to know what you really want to do after your graduate from JC. For my case, i am still trying to adapt to Uni even after studying for 2 years in NTU. I preferred my uni life more than jc as in uni no one forces you to go tut or lectures as the onus is on you. You need to choose what course you really want to do for the next 3-4 years', ""I graduated from YJC years back and am doing pretty well in NUS. I remembered that there was always this feeling of inferiority among the people I knew -- like we could never be as good as the raffles and hwa chong kids (like what u/FrostSurge mentioned). There was a sense of self-doubt on being able to excel. There was quite a lacklustre school culture (and to some extent discouraging). There was also not many opportunities to boost your portfolio unless you actively went out to seek for it. \n\nDuring my time, if you wanted to substantially bolster your portfolio, you had to actively search for opportunities to do so. They weren't usually readily presented to you (maybe cause i wasn't in TDP -- not sure if that made a significant difference).\n\nHowever, looking back, on the academic front, being in YJC (or now YIJC) doesn't mean that you cannot excel. Neither does it mean that you are destined to have a mediocre A Levels score and be unable to get into a local uni. There are YJC graduates who do really well in A Levels and I know of many who continue to excel in local and overseas uni.\n\nTo YIJC juniors, please don't think that being in YIJC mean that you are fated to be mediocre. Don't let this shackle you. Be ambitious and know that it is possible to be as good as the kids from other jcs and possibly even better."", 'Hi! I guess most of you who graduated in 2017/2018 will know this story but anyway, hoping that this will encourage the current juniors. \n\nI‚Äôm in NUS Law + USP now (and there are 2 others from the same batch with me + a YJ senior who was 2 batches above us - he had NS). There are others in my batch who are in SMU Law (or matriculating into SMU Law this year - Once again, NS), and generally, lots of us who made it into the local Us and are doing just fine. I was accepted into some of the top UK unis but had to reject because well.....I didn‚Äôt want to burden my parents and make them pay $100k a year when I could be paying $12k a year in SG.\n\nI was really disappointed by my grades at O Levels; I came into YJ pretty resigned. That misery translated into a very toxic mindset in my head initially and I felt super angsty that no one else was studying or seeming to put in effort. \n\nBut somewhere along the line someone told me that I could mope over my crushed dreams of being a small fish in a big pond (I.e. the elite JCs) or focus on being a big fish in a small pond. That really motivated me to do my best, and eventually hard work + God‚Äôs Grace helped me to do well for A Levels and brought me to where I am now.\n \nI was from HELM - the methods of studying are pretty much the same across the disciplines. For Lit, it‚Äôs all about the ability to closely analyze the text (Literary devices, etc). I made my own notes - they would summarize the main plot(s), themes in the book, significant turning moments, etc (i also downloaded a list of Lit devices and dramatic techniques from google) and whenever I read the allocated text I would annotate and cross-refer to the list of lit devices. History was slightly different - I remember doing mindmaps, tables (esp for SEA) and timelines so I could visualize the content better and absorb it faster. For Econs, I found that downloading the syllabus (because they tell you the main concepts they‚Äôre going to test) was very helpful - I went through every bullet point and tested myself as to whether I could explain those concepts in an essay, or apply them to a case study. For GP, I made notes for every topic (e.g. like globalization) and it would have the definition of the topic, global examples, and local examples (for AQ). For H1 Math, sad to say I really disliked the subject - and had beef with my math teacher!!! Until the later part of J1/early part of JC2 where we resolved our differences and I explained to him why I couldn‚Äôt really understand his classes. So I was scoring Us till prelim for Math (literally 30/100 kind of thing) but in between I made my own notes for Math (a consolidated list of all the necessary formulas, calculator shortcuts, etc), did a lot of TYS, past year prelim papers, and thank God I managed to pull it up to a C at A Levels. \n\nI know the study culture at YJ isn‚Äôt the best, but I‚Äôm very blessed to have had amazing teachers who really spent a lot of time helping us, though we were constantly harassing them for consults! I was really touched that some even stayed past 8pm to help us. I know some of them have left but I‚Äôm sure the current batch of teachers are as dedicated. They‚Äôve really become friends in a way, even after graduation - don‚Äôt wanna list them here but am eternally grateful for their support and encouragement, and for telling me off whenever they felt I was being too complacent. If your friends don‚Äôt want to study, even after you encourage them to, then just leave them alone!! It‚Äôs your future - and if they don‚Äôt want to take theirs seriously, what can you do?\n\nThat being said, the school isn‚Äôt (wasn‚Äôt?) very helpful when it comes to Uni apps. I nearly missed the Oxbridge deadline and had to rush my application no thanks to the career advisor who gave me the wrong info. It was individual teachers who helped me vet my personal statements + acted as my referees (absolutely love them for rushing things out for me though it was very last minute). I‚Äôve been talking to some of the teachers for a few years now about roping in alumni support to help students with uni apps! But that‚Äôs a work in progress, hopefully it can materialize soon.\n\nHard work matters. But consistency really is the key, and don‚Äôt expect to just do well if you think you can cram after prelims (I only know a handful of people who managed that). Pace yourselves too. All of the above gradually built up (I would study in the library/area outside the cafe) or anywhere else in school that was quiet during my breaks; gradually I stayed in school till 9pm and after prelims I went to the Starbucks near my house to study till the wee hours of the morning. Don‚Äôt burn out too fast. And the week of A Levels I just studied the bare minimum and ensured I got enough sleep. Otherwise you‚Äôd fall sick during the exams and all your hard work will go to waste. \n\nObviously, don‚Äôt deny yourself break times. Church, family, friends, were all major sources of strength. \n\nSeriously, so many YIJC kids have so much potential. We may not have the resources like the bigger JCs. But in a way the fact we don‚Äôt have that kind of culture is a blessing in disguise. A lot of them end up getting very pressurized / fall through the cracks because the competition is crazy. One thing I always loved about YJ is how kampong it felt and how down to earth everyone was. That being said, please stop having inferiority complex!!! When you come to uni you‚Äôll realise they‚Äôre actually not that different ‚Äî everyone‚Äôs just trying to get through life and do our best. Also, I‚Äôm not saying that Uni‚Äôs a breeze - it isn‚Äôt - but for now, focus on getting through the first hurdle.\n\nAll the best kiddos, I hope this helped - jiayous and do pm if you need more advice (on uni life too)!\n\nMy grades that year for reference: \n‚Ä¢ AAB/AAC (85 RP in total)\n‚Ä¢ For kids looking to do law - Got 26/42 for LNATs too for reference (the average that year was 19.9)\n\nTLDR: did well for As, here‚Äôs some tips on how to do well, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out x', 'hey! were u 2019 a levels batch?', 'True about the echo chamber !', 'Major relate!! But lmfao am guilty of the notes part lol, like I pay attention in lectures but when I study I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy using the school notes (only for Bio& Geog) because of the way some concepts are being explained or how some concepts are being organised (lmao yes I am that picky) but I wouldn‚Äôt say the notes are trash. However, if I were to compare to the other school notes that I am using currently, I‚Äôd just say it‚Äôs less in depth, and it might be helpful for some since like less content, but for me I prefer knowing the nitty gritty details to further explain the concepts to myself to understand better hahaha. \n\nFor subject tutors, it‚Äôs really a hit or miss..... like my Chem tutor is super good and super passionate and every tutorial lesson is extremely  fruitful but my Math tutor well..... he‚Äôs really nice and patient but sometimes he tends to just show the answers without explaining much, so like 90% of the time I‚Äôm just a lost sheep (but idk some of my classmates get him..... maybe I‚Äôm just really terrible in Math hahaha)', 'YJCian here, graduated in 2015 (but I still go back to visit every year for the past 5 years)\n\nAgree on the 2 echo chambers but there also existed teachers who were really not good at teaching (I had a few of that in my time, mostly in JC1, and one that was really bad in JC2).\n(When I came back these few years to visit I heard that most of them are gone, thankfully)\n\nOf course there are other teachers that are really good (and some of them were my teachers). \nMy GP teacher was the best teacher I‚Äôve ever met in my schooling life up until Uni (I‚Äôm in NUS now), and my GP lessons were filled with engaging activities (playing musical chairs for quizzes, card game for Paper 2 summary, role play/debate for training our reasoning etc).\n\nWhat‚Äôs really important is that one should be motivated to learn (not just study or mug) and I know that a lot of YJC students were unmotivated.\n\nIt could be the culture, or it could a self-defeatist attitude from not doing well in O levels, or it could just be surrendering to others‚Äô perceptions of what a ‚Äúgood‚Äù JC should be and feel upset becuz ours is not (I find this debatable.)\n\nbtw Thanks for your post and for encouraging the juniors :)', 'thanks I was legit really demotivated when i got into YI I literally cried when I got the message from MOE lol but I guess there‚Äôs a reason why I ended up here so I just need to work hard.

The school places strong emphasis on students to just get into a Local U and not anything beyond that. Tbh.... some teachers even dissuade students from pursuing Med/Law saying it‚Äôs too competitive. I‚Äôd say.... that the school doesn‚Äôt stretch or teaches it‚Äôs students to aim for higher goals (though understandably as ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt do well for Os‚Äù so chances of doing well for As is significantly lower although this is bs because there are people who did well for Os and flunked As and vice versa). Although I‚Äôm not sure if it applies to TDP kids because they have preferential treatment where they get to go for workshops which teaches them on how to build their portfolio for scholarships and writing of personal statements which is not offered to other students outside of TDP (lmao this is just too selective in my opinion because one can never know what will happen on results day.)

I think your mentioning about how students generally commit to pure memorisation is really true, and IMO is a huge factor to why many don't do well. 'A' level has been trending towards understanding concepts (especially for the science and math subjects, all with the new syllabus recently which contains many contextual application questions) and memorising notes simply don't work as well anymore."", ""Just wanted to say congratulations for your great improvement from prelims to 'A' level!

That was when people really started panicking for 'A' level as they are still not scoring well.

Is there anyone who can kindly explain how these module exemptions work?

One module is usually 4MC. Module exemptions vary for faculties.\n\nEdit: People usually take around 5 modules per semester, hence 4MC x 5 = 20MC', ""If you're from poly, you will automatically be granted 20 MC worth of APC to replace the Unrestricted Elective (UE) modules. So compared to your peers from JC, you will take 5 less UE modules. There's no need to take a test or specifically submit a request to get these 20 MC, it's automatic and I don't think you can reject it even if you want to.  \n\nIf you manage to fit your required modules into the other semesters, even without overloading, you can graduate 1 semester earlier.  \n\nHowever, say a module you want to take in year 4 is only offered in semester 2. Then you'll need to either plan to take that module in Y3S2, or choose a different module. So it depends on how you plan your modules.  \n\nYou can also choose to underload in Y3 and Y4 and graduate with the rest of your peers, like how some of my seniors are doing now.  \n\nSome majors, you can take a test to get advance placement credits. The list for FOS is [here](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduates/advanced-placement-credits/), just as an example.  \n\nAlso do take note the overall number of UE modules will depend on your major, cos each major has slightly different number of major requirement modules. But generally from poly you will need to take 5 less than the JC counterpart.  \n\nAlso take note you have lesser S/U credits available to use, by default, because of the 20 MC worth of APC."", 'Oh okay.

Cheesy rhymes aside, even if they do not/forgot to mention the dress code, come in smart casual (e.g, collar shirt). Don‚Äôt dress too formally (suit and tie) because that may look a little pretentious and tryhard, especially since this is an online interview.

Note: I am not in NS yet, wont be for a few years.

Ok, so i heard the NS medical checkup has a blood test, and I have a very big fear of needles. To the point where I had a mental breakdown on the spot when i found out there was a blood test (Note: i have not even been called for checkup yet) . 

I have gone to IMH and gotten a letter *requesting CPMB to consider excusing me from the blood test* but im not sure if they will accept it. I have had many mental breakdowns over the past few months thinking about the possibility of them not accepting the excuse, and have many times contemplated suicide before the checkup itself. Any advice on this? anyone know if this kind of letter is even accepted by them? pls help.

I told the nurse no, I‚Äôm scared of the injection itself, and he became rly unsympathetic and told me ‚Äújust don‚Äôt look‚Äù lol which tbh doesn‚Äôt help when the anxiety is alr inside your head (which I‚Äôm sure you know). ultimately I think I just froze up and let him do it bc the other option is to die anyway (and I got scolded for being ‚Äúso tense‚Äù) and I basically wanted to kms before and throughout the whole procedure.\n\nand no, I did not get over my phobia after this, but I hope this at least shows you it‚Äôs (psychologically painfully) survivable.

Maybe other seniors can chip in too!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fztrnk/a_level_h2_biology_help/,12,"['please share some helpful study tips + your study routine !!', 'hi, did As for h2 biology last year. i know that everyone has their own way of studying but i recommend these general tips: \n\n1) don‚Äôt leave everything to the last min, esp for biology. after every lecture (or every chapter if you‚Äôre lazy like me lol) is taught, consolidate what you‚Äôve learned. \n\n2) make your own notes if possible. imo the school notes are just too long for me to go through every time i‚Äôm studying for an exam; like when i get to the last page i don‚Äôt even rmb what the first page said and it‚Äôs just a mess. so to solve this problem i‚Äôd recommend making your own notes and be as concise as possible (but imptly!! do not neglect key words). label diagrams. mindmaps or point form wtv as long as your brain gets it. \n\n3) listen during tutorial QnA. i realised that the things my teacher went through during tutorials may have been overlooked during lecture but are definitely examinable, so putting a postit to remind yourself of these things will be super helpful eventually. \n\n4) when doing corrections, do your best not to just copy the answer. at least for me, when i copied the answer i wouldn‚Äôt really grasp exactly why THAT answer got the mark. so paraphrase in a way that is acceptable but really lets your brain know that it was THAT particular concept or keyword that was awarded the mark. \n\ni also have some h2 biology notes for specific chapters, you can pm me if you want them', 'On the same boat as the above post but please please understand that bio is not  *just* a mugging subject. I feel that understanding the content is crucial. Please do not look at bio by singular topics, but rather as a whole. All topics link together in some way or other. Here\'s my tips:\n\n1) Get yourself to sleep well. I cant emphasize enough how important sleep is. Please please try to get atleast 6-7 hrs of sleep everyday. Don\'t force yourself to be up at random hours to finish the tutorial. Honestly if you are getting nothing out of the tutorial (as some teachers don\'t even mark) then better not waste time doing it. \n\n2) Get the main idea + find out what you need to actually memorize for each topic (trust me when you do this, pages and pages of notes can be summarized into 1 notebook) key things: major organelles, functions. The 4 types of macromolecules: proteins, lipids, nucleotides, carbs. Transcription/Translation/DNA rep, Viruses, Cycles etc\n\n3) Content mastery: Memorize the relevant and important  things!! Please dont mug topic on topic!! I am sure you have heard of the phrase, ""Jack of all trades, master of none"". Its initally tough I do agree, but start of with topics of your interest/ whats easier. Have frequent revisions of the topics and you slowly realise its at your fingertips HAHA\n\n4) Questions strategy: This should be *only* considered when you have *truly* mastered content. You will come across patterns in answering of questions and I feel a good way of knowing it is thru practicing tys questions (not school papers, cos honestly the phrasing of school papers aren\'t the best, and the A level markers are cambridge). \n\n5) Continuation from 4):  Focus on your answering skills. Don\'t write content for all questions just because you are feeling/told to do so. Questions that are data-based do not require content unless they asked to explain the data. If its like describe data, you dont have to write content. Also, Phrase your answers properly!! You can write the same thing as your friend, but not using the correct terms or punctuation can cause your answers to be marked down. So work on your writing skills too.\n\n\nPlease please take these with a pinch of salt. What works for me doesn\'t have to work for everyone. I will continue to add/edit if I have other points/ I need to change some points. All the best!!', 'Hi I got an A for H2 bio last year!!

To anyone that took H1 Economics, can you teach me how to effectively study for H1 Econs? Tbh I prefer science over arts, but I'm forced to take a contrasting H1 subject, and Econs is the best option for me as compared to other arts subjects.

That's a good start :)\nEconomics isn't something to be memorised only but rather it's something to be understood + practice. By practice I don't mean just spamming papers after papers but rather sit down and carefully annotate the questions. Different keywords in the questions require different ways of answering, e.g. Describe the trend vs. Explain why the price of the good increase (Demand and/or supply factors). ALWAYS do question analysis. For every question, jot down what you think are relevant economics concepts needed for that question. Then when you look through the excerpts, you save time coz you'll only highlight the relevant parts that are needed for the question.\n\nSo I see you have answer keys too? Great, do look through them thoroughly & if you have examiner's report, also look through them. Examiner's report are a good way to know what kind of answers + concepts you need to know. \n\nHope this helps!"", 'Hi there, u sound alot like me HAHAHA except that i downgraded from h2 to h1 in j2. (Nevertheless h1 econs doesnt mean its easier so i didnt do well until mid years where my grade suddenly shot up to B after i change the way i study) I used to memorize alot of content, wtv that is in the lecture notes and just vomit them out in the questions. But it doesnt work that way, because h1 is about case study and how u use the material given. Hence analysing the case study and picking up the crucial information is really impt for you to quote them as evidence in your answer. Analysing the qns is rly impt too, dont overwrite for qns with little marks and spend more time on qns with more marks.\n\nHmmm so how to study for case study? I would say to practise more case studies and be familiar with the question types (Discuss, comment on, explain) etc and then compare your answers with the ""model answers"" (ans can diff base on diff perspectives). See how the ""model answers"" are structured to answer the diff qn types and use the method/technique to answer similar qns in the future. However does that mean not studying lecture notes at all? Ofc not, content is still important to guide you in what to include in the mini essays, while the question types are what gives you the direction to your essay.', 'Thanks man!

This year‚Äôs uni cut offs are particularly competitive, eg. 82.5rp rejected from sci but others with 82.5rp and MT A getting accepted because the additional 0.75rp boosted their rp to 83.25. Even com sci cut off is 87.5, with MT A = 87.75 which may grant you a direct entry. \nA few decimals may seem minimal, but they go a long way when competing for limited slots. In that light, MT grades are not completely useless. \n\nImo it‚Äôs not horribly difficult getting an A in MT because a lot of my classmates had B3/B4 but almost everyone in my class got an A in the end (we all loved our laoshi though). With that being said, everyone has different strengths. If you have faith in your other subjects and think that getting an A in MT is too difficult, don‚Äôt stress to get an A for MT and just focus on passing so you don‚Äôt have to retake it next year haha.

It's far more important that you do your PW well and get that A.\n\nIf this is a question on how mother tongue gets computed into rank points, it's your original rp plus mtl points divided by 100 times 90 again. So mathematically you can see how slim it is. \n\nBut aside from this, first, if you choose to do H2 work in chinese class, don't get caught by your laoshi since they might give you demerit points/scold you etc. Since you're bored, I'm not sure you like your laoshi, but personally mine grew on me, so I paid more attention as time went on and got to learn more chinese in JC1. Yeah, and now I can at least help my sis with chinese homework, so... I started with a B3 from O Level chinese, and I really had to work to not fail school chinese.\n\nWhen I eventually got a B for Chinese at As, this laoshi was also the one who recommended I don't retake, they told me to focus on my H2s now. In this same vein, make sure that if you choose to neglect Chinese, it's not till the point where you have to retake in JC2, because that will mean about 4 periods of Chinese again for more months. \n\nSo, your call!

With all this, you also need to practice under timed conditions.

While I can‚Äôt say that this gives me a 100% accurate understanding of what the NUS Architecture course specifically is like, I think an Architecture education anywhere possesses irrevocable similarities.\n\nYes the long nights are true, yes the weekly rejections are true, but really all those are inconsequential compared to the myriad things you take away from your education. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful that I chose to study it because I feel no other course coalesces so many other related disciplines. We‚Äôve touched on sociology, philosophy, literature and strived to incorporate that into the buildings or spaces we design. Outside of the defined parts of the curriculum, you also possess the freedom to determine the boundaries and objectives of your own project. If it‚Äôs film and movies you like, then you could incorporate a related narrative into your project. If it‚Äôs the ageing population you care about, then you could design something to make their daily lives easier. The way the course is shaped and the high degree of self direction involved would indubitably mould students into natural critical thinkers.\n\nAnd this is why the long nights and weekly rejections even exist in the first place. Ultimately, it isn‚Äôt the professors who are slave driving you to work so hard. YOU are the one determining the end goal of your project, so YOU are the one deciding whether to slog for it or not. You can always choose to do the bare minimum, as long as you submit the deliverables. Also, all this greatly depends on your own work style‚ÄîI know plenty of classmates who could get away sleeping a solid 6 hours every night, because they work incredibly efficiently.\n\nAlso to call it ‚Äòweekly rejections‚Äô is somewhat uninformed. The professors aren‚Äôt authoritarian dictators, they only want to make your project as good as possible! And unless they have deep seated personality issues to begin with, they would be civil and respectful and treat you like a practicing architect. During important reviews, they would even invite external judges, either from the Architecture industry or from related disciplines, who would offer extremely valuable insights to your project. You really get to witness an interesting dialogue and exchange of ideas‚Äîall centred around your project! \n\nArchitecture school is one thing, but the Architecture industry is another. Obviously the energy is less effervescent and the ideas less thought-provoking, because this is when real life constraints kick in. I really can‚Äôt tell you what it‚Äôs like, because your experience is heavily dependent on the kind of firm that you join. There are established big firms that oversee giant projects and deliver respectable and reliable designs, though not the most creative. There are energetic medium firms that seek to challenge the norms of design and produce iconic and expressive work. Then there are the boutique small firms who function as think tanks and design fresh and eclectic proposals. I‚Äôm sure these denominations are laden with stereotypes, but my point is, the Architecture cohort consists of so many types of people and they would eventually find a place in the industry, there‚Äôs really no specific ‚Äútype‚Äù that you have to be to work in the industry. With so many kinds of firms (I‚Äôm not kidding, there are SO MANY) out there, there‚Äôs really little problem in landing a job. The challenge lies in finding a job that‚Äôs highly aligned to your own sensitivities.\n\nThe amount of overtime vary greatly between firms. I‚Äôve heard of friends who have managed to knock off at 6.30 PM most days, latest at 8.00 PM, and friends who have had to work until 3.00 AM for sustained periods of time. It isn‚Äôt too bad honestly, but I will say this: if you‚Äôre studying Architecture just to make a quick buck, then the industry isn‚Äôt for you. The Effort to Reward ratio is mediocre. But if you‚Äôre truly interested in design and the built environment, or you enjoy project management, or if you have a naturally inquisitive mind, then gosh, the work we do can be really rewarding.', ""What are the negative feedback you've read?

[o levels] sec 5 student,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586624456.0,"Hi! Im a sec 5 student, just took my n‚Äôs last year(2019) and obtained a score of 11: eng-A2, math-B4, combined humans(ss/hist)-A2, pure lit-A2, combined sci(chem/bio)-b4, chi-A1. I‚Äôve decided to stay for sec 5 because i really wanna get into jc ! But tbh im not very confident since im a NA student & im the only one in my class that wants to get into jc. Ppl around me hv also been telling me that my expectations are too high(since im aiming for <10pts for my o‚Äôs). So i really need some tips to ace my o‚Äôs! I‚Äôve also starting revising every subject by doing tys & notes since late feb :>",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fz9n9b/o_levels_sec_5_student/,23,"['Dont let others stop u just work hard to prove them wrong', 'You\'ll need a game plan, like seriously.\n\nLooking at your scores, you\'re languages and humanities are your strength so that\'s much less to worry about. You\'ll need to spend more time on math and science though.\n\nThere\'s no trick to these 2 subjects. Math is all about practice and being flexible enough to ""twist and turn"" your formulae. As for science, bio chem is memory intensive, luckily you\'re doing combined Sci. Here\'s  what you need to do, write notes for every single chapter; draw, sketch, tabulate, summarise the information.\n\nOnce done, just keep doing papers until you get the hang of it. ALSO, pro tip: the pace of doing papers for O levels and N levels is very different, you\'ll need to time yourself well, or risk not completing the paper!', ""Hello! I was a sec 5 student as well. My N level results was so bad that I couldn't go for pfp. But guess what? I got 7 points for O levels after CCA points! Anything can happen if u work hard:) Since the rest are giving you good study tips, I'll just wish u all the best!!"", 'Just focus on your goal of getting into a JC! I too was an NA student and I too got 11 points for N-levels. I stayed for sec 5 for the same reason as you. My friends and even my teachers would discourage me but in the end i managed to get into a JC. \n\nSome of the things i did that have helped me get into a JC is to always pay attention in class and ask questions when in doubt. You should also start your revision early (which you fortunately have) because i feel that there is a considerable gap in terms of content and difficulty between o-levels and n-levels depending on the subjects that you are taking. Try to clear your content early by doing self study and then create your own notes so that more time can be spent on TYS. I also spent quite a lot of time in January exploring my interests and the path that i want to take in life hahaha. Being certain of where you want to go is important as it will motivate you to study and work extra hard. But motivation alone is not enough. You also need to have a routine. I had a to-do list where i keep not only the tasks that i need to accomplish for the day but also my daily routine. I feel like having a routine is very important because it keeps me focused and disciplined. I also gave myself time to rest and play. What i did was I only allowed myself to use my laptop for entertainment on weekends and on weekdays I would only be studying. I would play games like CSGO, Gary‚Äôs Mod and left 4 Dead with my friends to relief stress and recharge myself for the following week. I also went for a lot of extra classes and consultations which helped me tremendously. \n\nDon‚Äôt be affected by what other people say! If you are certain about where you want to go, ignore them and just focus on your goal. Good luck!', 'Just do alot of practice pprs like aft ur mye/prelims google all the other sch papers u can find and do them', 'learning how to not care about how others think of you is a good life skill', ""Don't hesitate even if you are just the only who wants to go to JC. That's even good because you are aiming high. So, go for it! You will surely make it because you have the drive. \n\nJust keep your good studying habits and always aim to do better each day. If there are topics that you find hard, ask a friend or join tuition classes. Don't be complacent because you are about to achieve your goal. You can do it!"", 'hi! i was a sec5 student, as well! my n levels was 9 points and o levels was 14points for L1R5! i went to jc and it was rlly tough for me~ work hard and study smart! take breaks in between and always clear your doubts early!!!! practice and understand! all the best \U0001f970', 'JC is a whole different ball game from Secondary school. In my opinion, it was much much harder, but I knew 11 pointers who ended up as top scorers with distinctions in H3 compared to 6 pointers not doing as well. Its mainly based on understanding in my opinion over plain mugging. Gone are the days where you can study everything away. JC requires you to study smart over studying hard.\n\nTo be honest, I‚Äôd rather go Poly. There‚Äôs a lot less stress as well as it being much easier to enter university. (Just look at the IGP for the university courses of your liking, its like 3.5 for aerospace which required AAA), remember, you are against generally weaker students in polytechnic.\n\nBut JC is still the safer choice to take, as messing up in poly will out you in a tough spot, not being able to enter uni.', 'Just wondering, but why do you want to go to a JC? Is there something that you‚Äôre looking for in a JC experience that a poly doesn‚Äôt? Or is it more of a prestige kind of thing?

To me, i think that every education path is specially catered to different students & theres no comparison as to whether one education pathway is better than the other. The reason why I wanna go to jc is because firstly, i feel that im more academically-inclined so i dont think i will be able to adapt to the more ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù style in poly. Also, i prefer the study environment in jc compared to poly, like the more structured kind of timetable & ive actually considered going to poly b4, but i realised that i did not have any interest in poly courses & i actually like studying a variety of subjects, as compared to poly, where they only focus on 1-2 courses !', 'I went from 5N to jc so if u hv any questions u can always pm me!!', 'i graduated already! gdluck :)', 'Thanks for sharing! My two cents of advice would be to keep your options open - don‚Äôt close off any paths at this point in time - you never know what you might find! \n\nIn any case, if your eventual path is to go to a uni, the stats are that 1 in every 3 uni student currently is from a poly (it may seem small but bearing in mind not every poly student wants to go to the uni as well). Also, the cohort progression from Jc to uni may only be 50-60% at some JCs, so that may be something else to consider too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'okay,, tysm !! :)']","[1586624590.0, 1586629011.0, 1586631545.0, 1586646752.0, 1586624641.0, 1586661731.0, 1586667914.0, 1586662910.0, 1586698720.0, 1586702837.0, 1586710590.0, 1586703762.0, 1586703807.0, 1586703851.0, 1586703961.0, 1586703994.0, 1586704063.0, 1586704138.0, 1586704244.0, 1586704741.0, 1586703815.0, 1586755455.0, 1586789814.0, 1586704792.0]","[29.0, 16.0, 9.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

[O levels] english help pls,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586616421.0,English is so hard man like the qns are so tough. To those who got A1 what did you do to get that? Any answering techniques u could share?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fz6pfm/o_levels_english_help_pls/,0,"['I think a lot of us who got an A1 for O Level English are actually quite intuitively good at English, so it\'ll be difficult for some of us to say how we got the grade. You can\'t really get the experience 16 years worth of reading, writing, and speaking fluent English in a year, and a lot of people will say you should \'read the news daily\' or \'read extensively\' or \'practice speaking\', but if reading the news made you smarter and more eloquent then I would expect the people who comment on the straits times facebook articles to be geniuses.  \n\nThat being said, I got an A1 for English in O\'s after getting Bs and Cs throughout secondary school. Doing well in comprehension I think relies on some answering tricks which you should probably ask your teachers about. Some English teachers are really nasty and if you feel like your EL teacher isn\'t helping you, you shouldn\'t be demoralised and seek another EL teacher instead.\n\nFor Oral, I think an important part is being comfortable and relaxed in front of the examiners. If you leave a good impression on them, they\'ll think better of your conduct. And also, if you are relaxed you\'ll do better than if you\'re nervous.\n\nAnd for compo, I think you should try and write the essay with the audience in mind. If you put cliches like ""It was a sweltering day and my back was stained with my really sweaty sweat"" or even ""The society we live in espouses traditional values"" or ""The dictionary defines man as a featherless biped"", then I think your examiner might feel that your essay is just another \'brick in the wall\' and give you a normal mark like a B or a C.

Was a B3/B4 student for english xd throughout my entire secondary life and managed to get a A1 for last years o level. \n\nFor composition my tip wud be to go for consultation with ur english teacher and write a compo every week and have them grade it for you. Ik that sounds kinda crazy but its actually doable. In fact i wrote 1 compo a day for a few weeks before o levels and slowly my marks crept up from 16/30 to 26/30 average. It rly improved my grammar and vocab and even spelling lol. \n\nFor compre i reccomend u analyse the o level paper from past years. Like see the answering technique and how to quote etc... Like a example wud be visual text qn whr they show u the picture then ask why they put the picture. The technique wud be smth along the lines of analysing the picture and describing it and explaining how it links to the qn. eg. the picture depicts ________ which suggests that ________. And the same for section b the 1st qn whr ur supposed to quote and emphasize on ur ans. Eg. ""Quote the quote"" emphasizes how/that____(change word given in the qn abt the description with a synonymous word.

1. 10 minutes from my house

2. NTU‚Äôs more recognised for its engineering courses

3. Highly specialised towards aerospace-related context

4.  Modules suit my interests


However, I have some worries e.g. highly specialised would limit my job opportunities to the aerospace industry only, NUS having a better reputation overall, NTU being more expensive.

But I feel that in Singapore, Aero industry is very limited as many have said to be MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) so unless you are willing to go overseas and/or is offered a job overseas then I would say it is very limited not just because it's specialised but more that Singapore is just too small to have a big Aero industry.\n\nAnd it seems like NUS Mech (Aero) has greater similarities to NTU Mech Aero specialisation in Year 4 so if I get offered NTU Mech, then yeah, I would have more issues deciding. But I've seen one said that the senior said that NTU Aero is like Mech which I still don't think is that similar but might be true?\n\nRegarding the pros on NTU I do think that the general consensus is like that so yeah. The cons of NTU I'm not too sure since I feel that both NTU's and NUS's reputation is similar? I've seen that profs for NTU might be boring but I do think it just depends on the school.\n\nBut I did not know that NTU was more expensive (never checked NUS about the fees) so I do think if money is a huge deal breaker then yeah NUS maybe.\n\nMight edit this as I learn more but I would say go for NTU's Aero since it's more focused on Aero.\n\nEdit 1: I totally forgot about the S/U thing so yeah, NUS has a better edge on that, and if you plan to take major/minor, NUS seems more flexible"", ""Sry this is abit irrelevant but I just wanted to say u r the first person I know of who viewed NTU's geographical location as a positive factor wow"", ""hi NTU engineering student here :) i've heard that NTU AE is pretty similar to NTU's mech eng course (they have quite a number of common modules), so AE knowledge should still be broad enough for u to go into a more generalised area in future! \n\nit's only that in terms of say, case studies, NTU AE has more aero-related context i guess? so for example for fluid mechanics, they'll learn that for planes. but maybe for mech it would be a wider variety of case studies?"", 'thank you! i‚Äôll KIV all of this!! i hope u get your offers soon!', 'ya i can cycle there', 'Hahah Nice!']","[1586605359.0, 1586623883.0, 1586676750.0, 1586606461.0, 1586667165.0, 1586671559.0]","[6.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

[O Levels] Elect History/SS SBQ formats,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586589741.0,"hello i am taking o levels this year and with HBL i am really stressed and scared for o lvls esp with mid years cancelled :‚Äù
i‚Äôd really like some help on question formats - especially surprise questions + some tips on how to identify question types (e.g. keywords to look out for)
some question types can be phrased differently without using the words ‚Äòreliable‚Äô or ‚Äòuseful‚Äô for example and it really confuses me what are the possible different phrasing for each questions?

- compare & contrast (the different phrasing of words really confuses me)
- reliability (i try to aim for the highest level but it‚Äôs really confusing what tool to use (tone, purpose, cross-ref, provenance + content/critical analysis of provenance(?)-i‚Äôve seen some people call it that though it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve heard before in school)
- usefulness (what is the difference between reliability &amp; usefulness?)

surprise questions:
i haven‚Äôt been exposed to many surprise questions yet, especially in history, so i would really appreciate if anyone could leave a list of possible surprise questions + the approach/format on them !! :‚Äù 

here‚Äôs one that i‚Äôve encountered (2009 nov o lvl paper) but i‚Äôm still not sure on the format:
‚Äúhow far does source A help you to decide if ___ was telling the truth in source B?‚Äù

thank you so much and i‚Äôm sorry if the phrasing and wording of this post is all over the place and messy !!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fyz03q/o_levels_elect_historyss_sbq_formats/,8,"['Hi! Please don\'t stress :< i took elective history and I found it really hard but it became easier when I started asking my teacher for help on things I dont understand. \nI can help you with  few things but please take it with a pinch of salt since I\'m no longer taking history in jc, and I might have forgotten some things üòÖ  but I\'ll try my best \n\nThis is for elective history SBQ:\n\n\nFor usefulness questions, (Is this source useful?), my teacher used to say ALL sources are useful, because they tell you something, but that does not mean that they are reliable. For example, a comic drawn by an artist about the rule of Nazis can be useful, because it tells us how the Nazi rule was like. But that does not make it reliable, because is it credible? Is the artist bias? So you will have to use your contextual knowledge for this. (Yes, the source is useful because it tells me... From my contextual knowledge, this DID happen) and give evidence, you can state the years to support it. \n\nFor reliability questions, it really depends on the context. For example, if they give you a source A showing the statistics on the economic growth (how the production of steel, metal has increased during Hitler\'s rule) of Germany and ask \'Is this source reliable in telling you how the Nazi rule positively impacted people?"" Then it could be reliable, because  the data shows that there was an increase in production of materials.\nBut from your contextual knowledge, you know that the textbook says the materials they produced were of deteriorating quality, and companies focused on exceeding the quota, so it is not reliable. \nYou can also use another source to cross reference. For example, if a source B, is an account of someone who worked in these areas, and the account describes how they were paid little for their work, and how they always had to work overtime and working conditions were unfavourable, then you can use that to say that, this source A is not reliable because source B tells you how these workers suffered, this negatively affected their lives. \nIt really depends on which tool you think will help you give the most compelling arguement. You can try practising the questions on the TYS and then ask your teacher for his or her opinion (I guess through messaging or online consultation since HBL is still ongoing üòÖ)\n\nThis is as much as I can help you with. I\'m not sure what you mean by suprise questions? Is that when the question asks (Are you suprised by this source? Why or why not.)\n\nSorry if my explanations are unclear HAHA I tried to explain the best I could. If you need anymore help feel free to dm me :) \nIt\'s best if you ask your teachers on the questions you don\'t comprehend clearly because they will give better explanations and the marking scheme or question format might have changed so my explanations might not be the most helpful. All the best for your Os! Remember to rest and take a break from studying every once in a while, and don\'t overstress okay! :>', 'Dinoster has given a good reply on usefulness, but I want to add on that if you\'re expected to (and usually are) have a paragraph on \'not useful"" remember to couch in terms of \'why\'.\n\neg. Source A is not useful in giving me an accurate depiction of life under soviet leadership because the poster is a glorified propaganda poster showing a life of plenty etc. CK tells me people starved etc. As with all your PEEL statements, your point should be clear from the beginning!\n\nFor surprise/diff format/interesting questions: I\'ve heard from juniors that it\'s getting increasingly flexible. If you wanna take H2 history in the future (YAY for hist!!) remember that flexibility is super key, because the phrasing can change in tonnes of ways. \n\nSurprise kind is the most standard - yes it surprises me because I don\'t expect a nazi official to tell me bad things about Germany. No it doesn\'t surprise me that Germany was really in a bad shape.\n\nHow far does it help me ascertain the truthfulness of the source - It helps me in terms of \'a certain domain/certain portion of the source\' but it doesn\'t for the other portion. AND/OR It doesn\'t help me because source A and B are both from the same perspective which I judge to be biased.\n\nBest thing about these things is that there is rarely a fixed structure! Comparison questions can be more limited in structure, but the new question types are much much less. Adapt to the new types and words they throw. \n\nHope this helps!

[Uni] SMU PPS vs NTU Soci,University :snoo_smile:,1586588609.0,"so i've recently received offers from both smu and ntu, and im really torn between the two so I came up w a list of pros and cons - what do you guys think wld be a better choice for me? NTU soci or SMU PPS? 

Pros of NTU:
- super near
- so much cheaper
- minor in envi sustainability 
- seems to have a lot of research opportunities (friend says it's hard to get tho)
- I like the mods for Soci, well the description appeals to me at least 

Cons of NTU:
- stuck in Soci, if i dont like it then yikes
- Soci is not their niche and employment seems worrying? idk
- Grading system is basically gambling w your grades 
- Lecture-Tutorial Style, less engagement and tends to be more academic oriented 

SMU Pros:
- seminar style, so you'll rlly get to interact w profs (and they seem rlly passionate from the interview)
- a lot of presentations and projects, builds confidence and interpersonal skills 
- a lot of intern and VIA opps
- soci is one of the smaller faculties 
- compulsory mods in pol sci, psych and soci, so u get to explore 

Cons of SMU:
- research opps? not v sure about this
- distance, 1h travel time 
- 16k compared to NTU 11k 
- ppl say it's vvv competitive 
- no S/U system
- must get magna cum laude to do well
- grading system makes it more stressful

It would not be that big of a deal if we were Singaporeans. Our income qualifies us for A LOT of bursaries that cover full tuition, some even including a living allowance. Life would be all fine and dandy since the government has our asses covered. 

Unfortunately, we're PRs. 

That leaves us out of most bursaries, and we're not smart enough to get a school scholarship. (Our RP averages at about 87.5, but my brothers and I are matriculating into CS and law respectively, where our scores are not enough to get a scholarship.) External organisations are another option, but interviews are still ongoing and everything is very very uncertain.

I will be matriculating into SMU Law this year. The school fees would be about $1.5k A MONTH subsidised. (And that's on fees alone, not including books, living allowances, transport etc etc) 

I have scoured their website looking for bursaries, and the only one that I am eligible for is an SMU bursary that gives me about $1.5k a year. (SMU Access is only for SCs unfortunately.) While that would be tremendously helpful, it does mean that the bulk of my tuition fees would have to be loaned, and I will graduate law school saddled with debt, lel! 

I will definitely be working part time during the course of my degree, but given how rigorous the law curriculum is, as well as how little part-timers generally earn, there is only so much I can do. I assume that I'll earn enough for my living expenses, but that's about it. 

So here is my cry for help: Is there any sort of financial assistance that I can apply for that can cover some part of my tuition? The amount doesn't have to be big, anything helps :')

EDIT: I don't think there's actually any other bursaries I can apply for; so instead I'll just take the loan, work part time, work hard and hope I get a mid term scholarship!

2. NTU has a slightly bad reputation for bad professors, is this also true in REP?
3. Do I need a portfolio for the interview and stuff?

Look at the entire spectrum, such as the location of the uni, CCAs, on-campus accommodation, internship programs, etc. Consider how your lifestyle will be different for each. Decide for yourself what matters to you most and pick the school you think is the most suitable for you.

so I'm intending to apply for RCs and currently working on my essays. But im having a hard time to choose which RC i shld put as my preference...  Im considering rvrc, tembusu and RC4

I heard rvrc is more of sustainability/environment, and I'm quite into that (my portfolio oso in line with it) , but I heard only a few can get room w ac...? and im not sure how the interview for rvrc is like. 

also considering tembusu college cuz of their focus on diversity and i perceive they oso hv a hint of environmentalism...? (animal of the year initiative and field trips and all) but I saw on another post that they r more towards critical thinking and writing which im not sure if thats my cup of tea. BUT, I read abt tembusu's interview, they will give u a passage to read on the spot followed by a grp discussion? I rly dun think I can do well in this kind of interview cuz im not v gud at voicing out my opinions. My first choice is actually tembusu but their interview kinda throw me off. For RC4, i heard their interview is not as 'scary' (lol its quite an impt consideration for me...)

I still remember during my interview, one of the other students was using 'The Matrix' as a comparison to the issue of internet privacy, and I still asked him to explain about the movie because I didn't watch it. I'm not saying you should do that during the interview, but just have fun and share your own unique perspective on the issue! (Hint hint: Diversity!)  \n\n\nRegarding the focus, we do have activities pertaining to environmentalism, but I don't think that 'critical thinking and writing' is really their main focus? Maybe it's because I'm not too sure about the other colleges, but I feel that no matter what module you take, critical thinking (and writing, though I think it's more about how easy it is to understand your text rather than making it beautiful) will always be involved.   \n\n\nThen again, I'm not really the best rep of Tembusu, but I hope this gives you an idea! I think another factor you might want to consider are the IGs of each college. For me, there was an IG that wasn't offered anywhere else, which played a big factor in my choice of RC.

T_T,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fxq3nq/jc_dropping_h2_econs_to_h1/,5,"['Hi, I didn‚Äôt take H1 but in my opinion if your essay is good I feel that the reason why your grades may be suffering is not actually because you can‚Äôt cope with the content (because otherwise you would do badly in essay as well) but rather because your CSQ is pulling you down maybe because you don‚Äôt know how to make use of source material to answer the questions? If that is the case dropping to H1 where the only mode of assessment is CSQ may actually hurt you. Basically just try to pinpoint what exactly you are struggling with. If it‚Äôs the amount of content, then maybe you should drop to H1. If it‚Äôs because your CSQ answering technique is weak, I suggest you don‚Äôt do that. All the best!', 'I wouldn‚Äôt advise dropping from H2 econs to H1 as I feel the only difference to in doing that would simply be fewer essays to answer. Honestly, the standard of H1 and H2 is the same. Econs skills are transferrable between CSQ and Essays (and CSQ have mini essays too so whats the dif) Only difference is that CSQ uses source evidence while Essay uses real life examples (have to memorise). \n\nBesides, Essays are really easy to score if you plan well. Its level based marking and hence I would emphasize on this few criterias of a good essay. (1) Scope: Range of perspectives (2) Depth: Content development (Did you use economic analysis with diagrams and evaluation) (3) EXAMPLES: this is the main dif between L3 and L2. ie 9 marks vs 7 marks. (Assuming your content is accurate and you answer the qn) \n\nEssays can also be developed from reading model answers and identifying how they elaborate their content. \n\nCSQ on the other hand, may be harder if you cannot apply the content to the context given. Hence, CSQ rly got to practice. Always aim to use Knowledge-Evidence to answer. Lift evidence from extract and explain it in terms of econs jargon. \n\nI studied this way and improved from 46% (E) (J1 MYE) to 68% (B)(Promos) to 86% (J2 block test). But of course, 4 H2s are rly heavy and if you rly cant cope, you shld drop it! Feel free to dm me if u got qns.', 'Same situation as you last year, essays better than csq scared cant cope with h2 and all that. But you have to realise once you drop your entire grade is determined by CSQ so if you are not too good at that then gg. I suggest you dont drop and keep practicing CSQ by online paper or consultations. Once you get comfortable with CSQ, you will naturally start to see your grades go up as well. \n\nJust my opinion', 'Hello! I dropped H2 econs to H1 econs last year when I was J2. \n\nReasons why I did so was because:\n* Significantly lesser content for H1 as compared to H2 (only 2 elasticity concepts instead of 4, no market structure, no globalisation & trade for macro)\n* Easier to cope, had more time to focus on other subjects (for me, GP)\n* I hated writing so much for essays HAHA hand dieded after every practice/exam\n\nReasons that made me hesitate dropping:\n* My essays were scoring slightly better than my CSQs, and I found CSQs quite hard in J1\n\nWhile CSQs may seem daunting, its important to note that you will get alot more practice doing it in J2 if you do choose to drop!! I don‚Äôt regret dropping to H1 at all because I really hated market structure :‚Äù) \n\nBut... on the flip side I do know a friend who made the choice to not drop H2 Econs and benefited from it as her other H2 subject scored a lower grade and hence her Econs grade helped to pull up her RP\n\nWhether you choose to drop or not is one thing, but more importantly, make sure to follow through with effort regardless of whether you‚Äôre taking H1 or H2 Econs! :) All the best for JC!', 'a U in h2 econs has the same rp as a U in h1 econs so dont drop /s', ""Didn't drop but if your essays are better than case study then I would advise against dropping since H1 is all case study and they have one more 10 mark question for each case study so is 80 total for a single paper while H2 is just 60 for paper 1. If you are losing out on the 2-6 mark ones then I would say either you are wasting time on them and/or don't know how to write the short ways of explaining a process and/or basic understanding of a concept. If it's the 8-12 mark ones then it's also either time management, don't know how to pick out points in the case study to write about etc.\n\nConsult your teacher about it because he/she would know what you have been writing.\n\n(And I know someone who dropped and he said that H1 was harder for him because of the lack of essays but that's for him so think about yourself and what you have written.)"", ""Thanks!!

Then, RP emailed that I was successfully accepted through DAE to the course that I opted for (which I suspected is through my Os results instead of my As results)

I tried to write in to RP but I received no reply back. I wanted to clarify if the course that I was accepted into, will it be a 2 years course or a 3 years course since it is probably DAE through my Os results. 

I was also thinking to apply for the DAE through As results for the Oct intake.

Anyone has any ideas what is the difference between DAE through Os and As? 

And also how does the Oct intake works? like for a 2 or 2.5 years course. eg: when will be the graduation? when can go uni? etc

If your topic statements are good and hit salient tensions of the question you should at least hit 15m-16m. Then from there, the difference between a 15m and a 20m essay is how rigorously you use textual evidence and interpretation to back up your topic statements.

It's not something that you replicate by reading model answers (not that we really get many lol) but by knowing your text very very well, and being inspired by the question that is presented to you.\n\nOften, the first thought, no matter how fleeting, is worth talking about because that's how the question makes you feel, and it lets you engage with the question on a personal and sensitive level. \n\nI'm not sure of the current rubrics, but my teacher once used on which said that the highest band goes to students who provide insights the examiner had not thought of before, that had a high level of expression, personality to the answer and sensitivity to the text.\n\nThat said, my best tip to revising is not spamming practice essays, but to simply read more and more of the poems everywhere, to draw lines of similarities and pick out things that repeat.

I used to be a full on extrovert always voicing out my opinions and being generally loud from young. But once i entered this JC, my character has changed for the worse. For the first time in life, i have become an introvert and i am rlly scared ppl would judge me. I dont dare to voice out my opinions anymore.

In addition, i simply cant seem to make frens. When i was in my OG, i feel like i didnt click with people there but fortunately i had my sec sch fren with me in my OG and she faced the same prob. During OG i was with her so i didnt feel rlly lonely. I talked abt this to my frens and they all said in class you can click with ppl and find frens there. They asked me not to worry. But once i got to know my class, most of them knew each other either thru sec sch or OG while didnt know anyone. I tried hanging out with ppl but like i cant seem to click with them. If i am silent, they wont even know that i am there although i would be sitting in the same table as them. I feel rlly insignificant and lonely in jc.

Hi everyone! I think the COVID-19 HBL crisis has brought out the best in many people and it's been really heartening to see so many initiatives popping up for students.

As a 2019 JC grad my kokoro goes brokoro thinking of the JC kids who will be losing a lot of academic support in this time (as if A Levels weren't hard enough!) Especially for us Arts/humanities students, having consults cancelled & teachers overloaded is absolutely devastating because getting our practice essays marked is the absolute bread and butter of improving in our subjects. (With CCAs cancelled, there's also so much time to write essays but little resources to mark them :c ) There's been a lot of help in free 1-1 tutoring and AMAs, but still a gap for Arts students who don't need to learn content but need to practice argumentation.

I'm in no way a professional but (a) I do have more experience than your peers (b) probably also way more time than your megastressed teachers and your other stressed peers. 

**TLDR:** If you need a critical eye to review and feedback on your practice essays for H2 ELL and History, you can email them (and the questions/question paper) to [humansforhoomans@gmail.com](mailto:humansforhoomans@gmail.com) ^((haha because humans for people but also humans for humanities...))

* I'm only confident/qualified to give feedback for H2 History and ELL ^((topped Hist for Prelims, topped ELL both J1 and J2, A's at A-Levels for both)), but if anyone would want this for other Arts subjects comment below! I can try to cobble more friends to help. *If you are keen to help in any subject, drop me a DM!*
* No hidden costs!! You can send in as many essays as you complete (but please lah, send work you've put effort into, don't just spam). But if you find the essay reviews super helpful, consider paying-it-forward by donating to help COVID-19 relief efforts (eg, my suggestions, [buy a meal for now unpaid migrant workers](https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/covid_19_support_fund_for_our_foreign_workers), or [buy meals for  Singaporeans hard-hit by the economic slump+support local food providers](https://www.giving.sg/the-food-bank-singapore-ltd/covid-19_relief_feed_the_city_take-away_edition_) )

Was a B3/B4 student for english xd throughout my entire secondary life and managed to get a A1 for last years o level. \n\nFor composition my tip wud be to go for consultation with ur english teacher and write a compo every week and have them grade it for you. Ik that sounds kinda crazy but its actually doable. In fact i wrote 1 compo a day for a few weeks before o levels and slowly my marks crept up from 16/30 to 26/30 average. It rly improved my grammar and vocab and even spelling lol. \n\nFor compre i reccomend u analyse the o level paper from past years. Like see the answering technique and how to quote etc... Like a example wud be visual text qn whr they show u the picture then ask why they put the picture. The technique wud be smth along the lines of analysing the picture and describing it and explaining how it links to the qn. eg. the picture depicts ________ which suggests that ________. And the same for section b the 1st qn whr ur supposed to quote and emphasize on ur ans. Eg. ""Quote the quote"" emphasizes how/that____(change word given in the qn abt the description with a synonymous word.

Like if the qn is abt going overseas u can say udl it cos u miss ur mom when going overseas and altho ppl say ur a mommas boy ur proud of it and that u love her and then tell them abt a trip u went on or wtvr.

Instead, help someone out, or share with your friends what you've learnt here. I believe in karma, so no worries abt me. Ask away"", 'I take it you\'re J2 this year? \nThere are 2 options you can choose:\n\n1. Screw the learning, just want the grades. \nYou need to practicing with the answer key. Look at the question, look at the answer key and copy all the steps one by one, then repeat until you see some pattern that you can latch on. Dont expect a A/B with this strategy, because novel questions will throw you off. Also, because this is mainstream strategy, you will likely get average grades. But average is decent, and to some, decent is good enough. Where to get questions with step by step answers? Your school lecture notes and TYS. \n\nNote: you HAVE to find the pattern to solve the questions you copy, otherwise, you are no better than a photocopy machine. You will get the same grades as a photocopy machine.\n\nAlso note: if you get real good at pattern recognition, with abit of luck, you might still get an A/B, in spite of a lack of deep understanding. \n\n2. Actually learn\nYou need to understand WHY you are learning these topics, rather than what or how to apply. This is a lifehack method to learning. Have you ever had an experienced with a loved one that taught you a lesson you will never forget? Yet for dry subjects like math, the formulas and concepts slide off your brian like water off a duck\'s back. That\'s because they lack meaning - the ""why."" You will understand that without it, it is an uphill battle to understanding, even memorizing is difficult. On the other hand, if it were meaningful, you wouldn\'t even need to think twice in the exam to recall the formulas and concepts. Your mind works like clockwork, and you can even wrestle with novel questions to come up with a good answer. Getting an A/B is much easier with this strategy, but it requires a different mindset. You cannot be seduced into blind ""mugging"" like other students do. You know that focusing on conceptual understanding is an investment that pays good exam performance in dividends. \n\nUnfortunately, you can\'t just read your school notes to get this. Notes are intended to pack information in a concise fashion, not be a novel. It is the teacher\'s job to bring out the ""why"" of the topic in a meaningful way. But you can\'t choose your school teachers, so ask your friends who have a deeper understanding of the topic. Alternatively, you can find tuition to help. But be selective of your sources, they need to teach you what you are looking for, not rote learning (recall option 1), which many advocate. Otherwise, you could do that on your own. You need to pursue understanding, and be selective of your sources. \n\nIf you do this, the path will be smoother for you, and you\'re likely to do well not just for JC, but for your future endeavors. Again, not easy, you need the right mindset and help. I did this and got A for H2 maths years ago. My students also make drastic jumps in their grades. \n\n\n\nThere you have it. Two simple strategies. \nIf you have read this far and took the time to internalize the ideas, you will have gained a good profit. \n\nP.s. I like your question, because it was honest. Motivated me to give this full sharing. Keep them coming', ""Hi! I'm J3 and took H1 Math as well; may I know exactly which part in pure math you're unsure about?"", ""Here's the funny truth. You alr have what it takes to visualize. \n\nThe paper you practice questions on? That's a plane.\nThe pen you use to write? That's a direction vector.\nFix the pen to a point, and stretch it infinitely? That's a line .\nTake the pen and dot the paper, that's a position vector. \n\n\nYou dont need fancy tech to visualize. Just up to 3 pens and a few paper, and abit of creativity"", 'Vectors: also, one common problem among students that they dont realise is to *RUSH INTO THE QUESTION* before visualizing it. This is a topic you have to slow yourself down in the exam to understand what the question is talking abt, and what they want.', 'Vectors: I\'ve given some advice on vectors in another comment here, please look it up. Ask if you have any further questions\n\nPnC: I\'ve also given advice on PnC\n\nProbability: Usually tests venn diagram or tree diagram (occasionally table of outcomes). You also need to know independent vs mutually exclusive formula, and conditional probability will almost surely come up ""P(A|B)""', ""1. P&C is arguably one of the toughest topics in JC math. Ironically, it is not the heaviest weightage. My advice is to clear the bigger chapters first (calculus + rest of stats). Only when you've reasonably mastered those, and cleared your other subjects, then you can hone in on this topic. Your are juggling many balls. Prioritise. \n\n2. Plan the day based on what you want to do, rather than the work you need to complete. Then fit the neccessary work in. (Eg. Read a novel. I will complete so-and-so assignment to reward myself with 30min of reading. Repeat until all work is done, and you enjoyed what you wanted to enjoy in the day) you'll find more motivation, and sustain this lifestyle longer \n\nNote: Set an alarm clock to avoid reward binging, or get someone to keep you in check. Friends may be a tempting choice, but I find parents are more effective."", ""Please get TYS Topical for JC math. Not sure if popular is still open, but you may be able to buy an e-copy online. Alternatively, you can look for JC school papers, but those aren't usually sorted by topics."", 'Most welcome. You are not alone, many students face the same issue. I even had a HCJC J1 stud did poorly early last year for H2 math- but he was used to scoring A\'s for math all the way since primary sch. That was a shock for him. \n\nLikewise, he could do the lectures and tutorials. What was missing was a deep understanding of the topics and the skill to understand questions. We worked on it in lessons together. (Refer to option 2 strategy, "" actual learning"", in one of my other posts). My student went to score a B in 1 month, then moving on to top his class later on in the year.\n\nFor yourself, if doing it on your own, I advise to redo these assignments and test paper under time conditions. See if you can score better this time. This is more of option 1 strategy (practice using pattern recognition), but what is good is that you can start on your own. If you still do poorly, this is a red flag. Seek help immediately. \n\nAs for doing more practice, I always say this to my students: *"" practice doesn\'t make perfect, practice makes permanent.""  * If you dont understand (or at least recognize the pattern) how to solve a question, no point practicing that question over and over. What you\'re doing is repeating the same mistakes, so you just get better at making those mistakes.', 'okay thank u!', 'Thank you!

Hi fellas, I didn't manage to get a spot in a poly for this year's JPAE. ITE just didn't go my way no matter how hard I tried or studied. GPA can't even buy chicken rice haha. Super bummed out.

So anyways, I'm going to try and appeal to RP for a spot which honestly is a 99% chance of rejection but I still want to get a diploma at least. What are the options I have to further my studies? I have looked around at private diploma but my only worry is cost and credibility for the diploma. I've always been told that that private diplomas are not very recognized and not worth it. Going overseas is fine for me but i'm lost at what I should look for when looking at overseas schools.

I did engineering in ITE and am looking to either continue with engineering or switch over to IT, specifically networking or cyber security. Any help is deeply appreciated. Thank you.

[uni] GPA requirement for overseas universities,University :snoo_smile:,1586313331.0,"I go to HCJC and the internal exams are legit so difficult,, (any HC kids here, I reached double digits/32 for the latest ss test and that was already a glorious moment) I'm confident that I can score decently for A levels but because of the difficulty of internal exams, worried that my poor GPA will give a bad impression. (Since Overseas unis, especially in USA, almost always require you to provide GPA for high school years)

I know that they'll compare your GPA to people from your school but there are always insane people (china scholars I'm looking at you) that fly high. 

So what I'm asking is, will a relatively poor GPA drag me down significantly even if I do well for A levels? Different universities put a varying amount of emphasis on GPA (UCs focus more on gpa I think) so advice about the general standard would be good. 

Thank you for your time! Hope everyone's doing well and staying at home :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fwy4z2/uni_gpa_requirement_for_overseas_universities/,5,"['Hello! I‚Äôm from hwach too and I applied for US/UK universities and got into a number of them, so I thought I‚Äôd chip in. \n\nI think this is clear but GPA will not be used for US unis (because you take a levels), rather they will look at your grades in terms of how many As/Bs you have (not RPs). They have certain factors they consider when looking at your grades, including the academic rigour of your classes (Are you taking H3? How many academic units are you taking? Are you maximising the academic opportunities given by Hwachong?) and look at your grades in comparison to your peers. Don‚Äôt fret if you get a few Bs, but note that your grades should be at least in the top half of your level. If you‚Äôre not doing well now don‚Äôt worry, (iirc) Hwachong knows that internal exams are hard and only sends your J1 overall, Prelims and predicted results to the schools. Pick your battles and don‚Äôt study so hard for BTs (at least that‚Äôs what I did), just make sure you do well for J1 overall and Prelims. You are right, UCs do care more about grades, so keep that in mind when you apply to them, my friends that got offers from Berkeley/LA all had stellar academic results (I‚Äôm talking 85 RP and above for prelims kinda stellar). \n\nSo to answer your question, yes, poor results will hurt you. Take note that hwachong sends your predicted grades (from your prelims) to the schools and if your internal results are poor, your predicted grades will likely be on the Low side too. This will hurt your application since you‚Äôre only sending in predicted grades as your only indicator for your As performance. UK schools might not offer you if you have bad grades. Same for US schools. In fact, US school do not look at your actual A level results (unless you‚Äôre a guy and you apply in NS). Their rationale is that your general performance should reflect your academic ability. However, even if your grades don‚Äôt look so good, as long as they compare well to your peers (I‚Äôd say top 30% in cohort at least don‚Äôt quote me on that), you should be set. Put yourself within the A percentiles in your prelims so that that your predicted grades will be all As. That should give you a good chance at most universities you apply too. Your As performance is important, but only so you can fulfil your offers for UK universities and only to show US universities that your grades have not slipped significantly. You are offered before your a level results are even sent so your internal examination results need to be good in comparison to your peers.  \n\nI also need to clear the misconception that a good SAT score is enough to tide you through bad grades. In fact, I personally don‚Äôt even think SAT scores are that important. I know a friend with 1400s that got into a very selective liberal arts college. US universities know that our academic curriculum is rigorous and would rather see you performing well in such a difficult curriculum. So yes, SAT score is important to get you considered but as Long as you fall within the 25th - 75th percentile of whatever school you‚Äôre looking for, that‚Äôs good enough. My SAT score was not amazing for hwachong standards, but I fared well in the end.\n\nThat said, even if you think you grades aren‚Äôt as good for some schools that you apply for, I‚Äôd suggest apply anyway, as Long as you have some schools on your list that are a good match to your grades. The key thing about US admissions is that it is so arbitrary and random, because there are too many factors to consider in the admissions process. Do you fit the profile of applicants they need this year? If you play a certain instrument or do X extracurricular, how many students do they need that play this instrument or does X extracurricular? Please note this: good grades doesn‚Äôt guarantee you a spot at any university (even the supposed easier ones with 30% acceptance rate), you need to fit the specific applicant profile of the applicant they want.\n\nDiversify your US university list, expand it to include universities you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have considered. I know a lot of amazing friends that applied all ivy leagues and got all rejects. You need to apply to a mix of target, reach and safety schools because as internationals, the process can be even more random for us. Take me for example, I got into an Ivy League but was waitlisted at NYU (note: NYU is not a safety school lol), the application decisions just do not make sense in the way you think they do. It is also important to know what major and course you wanna study in, because every US university has its niche and is good at different courses.\n\nOf course, your grades aren‚Äôt the only factor if you wanna go US. Do well in your extracurriculars, Most importantly, write well and keep writing. This is the one factor that will set you apart from most Singaporean students and may soften the blow of not-so-good grades in your application. Draft your common app essay early and have your friends read through it. Go through multiple revisions, review your supplements. Sell yourself as an applicant that can contribute meaningfully and is a good fit for the school. Friends (and myself included) who got into their dream schools put in an insane amount of effort into our applications. It‚Äôs not like UK where good grades and an okay personal statement will get you into most schools. If you want to go to a US school, you gotta research into the process and try to game it as much as possible. You got this!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions :)', 'HC don‚Äôt use GPA though but just rank points/ABCs since that‚Äôs the end goal (A‚Äôs) but you don‚Äôt really have to worry that much...The overseas universities usually will know that internal school examinations (especially like HC with quite a reputation) will be more difficult than the actual A‚Äôs so they wouldn‚Äôt be expecting you to get straight As for those exams.\n\nMy advice is to just try to do as well as you can and stay within the top XX% as far as possible so that your predicted grades will be high. I didn‚Äôt apply for US but they consider applicants in a more holistic way as well so you may want to consider how else to stand out other than your grades.', ""Which overseas unis are you looking at? Which country? What majors?\n\nUS unis won't care too much about your GPA too much if you have a strong SAT score and good application essays. Depends on how competitive the school and your desired program is. Like Ivy League and some of the more competitive public schools like Berkeley may be a different ball game.\n\nUK will look at your grades in subjects related to the program you apply for. So like if you're applying for English they will look at your Lit grade but not your math grade. Like before, Oxbridge might be a bit different."", ""Just do well for your prelims straight B at least (?) and get predicted straight As or close to it anyways. I didn't make it for prelims and my midyear and block tests were S&U trash. \n\nEven though I did well for J1 End of Year exam and A levels, it didn't help my application and I failed going to top US unis. \n\nBtw grades r more important than CCA/extra stuff/essays. Without CCA/any extra stuff u can still make it to top Liberal Art Colleges in US with financial aid (my friend did). But without grades like me, u can go nowhere LOL. \n\nBut then again I'm not from Hwachong which consistently feed students to top overseas colleges so I don't know.""]","[1586316229.0, 1586314466.0, 1586314225.0, 1586323397.0]","[10.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]"

Also, anyone has any indication of what their cut off is? ""Completion of 12 years of education"" seems a little vague to me, surely it's stricter than that.

"[A levels] Being mediocre is worse than failing rn, I need advice",A Levels :snoo:,1586241152.0,"I am a J2, taking PCME. For the majority of J1 and now my MCTs, I've been getting average marks for my exams except econs (S) lmao. Initially, I was satisfied with getting 50s as I knew JC was tough. But over time, I just got worse and worse. Despite this, every time exam season kicks in, I put in a lot of effort and just about manage to scrape another 45-50 for each subject. 

So some of you may ask, what's the issue? I should be ok or even happy with my passes right? Well, being mediocre means you are neglected by the teachers who think you have done OK. This means not being down for remedials and teachers not checking my work etc. I have taken advantage of this, and not done a lot of my tutorials, which I think will eventually lead to my downfall. 

This is why I say being mediocre is worse than failing right now, because I end up becoming satisfied over my average marks and proceed to slack. Of course now that I have identified the problem, I want to address it. But the problem is I do not know any way of studying consistently and I feel quite scared to consult my teachers because I'm scared of getting whacked for asking those type of basic qns (esp by my strict math teacher).

This method of comparison is often true. When I had to collect the cert separately for those 80+, the people i saw were mostly (when i say mostly like 95% shockingly) were already the ones who get principal honor roll. And my friends who constantly get average actually end up getting RP which is hovering around the school mean RP. Thus u can predict technically your actual A level score range.

"[a levels] need advice from people who wanted to go into art stream, but were forced into science stream",A Levels :snoo:,1586236434.0,"

okay so ill summarise my situation right now.

i want to go for a lit based course in uni and was aiming for a scholarship as well, and hence aimed for an arts stream, bc i knew i could do rly well, and get a good rank point. i mean, youll be more likely to get a scholarship with a better rank point right?

but i was forced by my parents to go into the sci stream, and the only way i could take h2math and h2chem as they wanted was if i went into mi, so here i am, in mi, taking h2 math and h2 chem.... both subjs that im like only okay at. need to put in alot of effort esp bc i didnt take amath or pure sci, and my math isnt that good in general.

(im taking a h2 lit which is the only thing im rly happy w learning and stuff haha)

anyways

im stuck here... in mi for 3 years.... to learn sciences i really dont want to... and bc of this my rank point is most probably gna be lower than what it might be in an arts stream... 

so i just want to know: 

1) does my possibly lower rank point situation affect my chances of getting a scholarship in a lit based course?

2) people who are/were stuck in sci stream when you wanted art stream, any advice or words of encouragement to get me through these three years? anything is helpful!

thank you and i hope everyone is safe n healthy ‚ô°‚òÜ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fwelmx/a_levels_need_advice_from_people_who_wanted_to_go/,7,"['hi!! i was from mi (graduated last year), from arts.\n\n1. yes! scholarships are really dependent on your rank points. even if you have a stellar portfolio, it still depends on merit no matter the course. you‚Äôll need to try for at least 87.5+ rp to stand a chance, tbh.\n\n2. i know someone who was forced into science and did alright, but mi‚Äôs arts and commerce streams usually produce much better results than science (i‚Äôm not sure why? i do know my teachers were absolutely amazing though). you can do, just gotta work really hard :) please don‚Äôt slack off in y1!', 'Hi how are the education in MI? I am retaking my maths and science tis year for o levels and i am planning to come to MI next year. Are the subjects hard in Mi esp maths cos my maths is not very strong but i am gonna do my ultimate best this year.', 'Ya definitely. Scholarships look at Overall RP (Not by subjects) + other internal/external achievements.\n\nTo encourage you, Sci subjects are usually easy to do well with consistent practise and clearing of doubts. What motivates me for sci subjects (I take hybrid Math Physics Geog and Econs) is that it is easier to check your answers since theres always a definite answer and you do get credited for method. Also, Sci subjects dont require you to memorise as much stuff as Art subjects do, which frees up a lot of your ‚Äúmemory space‚Äù. Generally my sci subjects are A, while the art subjects hover between C and B. (And I study art subjects for longer periods of time) So ya, art subjects rly hard to score in school exams (for me). You shld be relieved haha! At least you got Lit :)', 'I‚Äôm answering this question assuming that by ‚Äúarts‚Äù, you‚Äôre referring to humanities instead of the performing arts / visual arts bc i‚Äôm a clueless fool when it comes to them \n\n1. It definitely affects. scholarship providers often say that judge you holistically, but that doesn‚Äôt undermine the importance of rank points, since it‚Äôs one of the fastest ways to filter people. (UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUPER OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO & tbh since you‚Äôre  doubting yourself, i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs bc you don‚Äôt have one) and i can tell you this is probably one of my biggest regret, bc although i did well for humanities at a levels, my sciences (which made up a huge chunk of my subj combi) screwed up my rp. so if you really want a lit-based scholarship , you should try your best in sciences too (but ofc focus should be on lit since it‚Äôll be pointless if u get straight As but B for lit HAHAHA)\n\n\n2. I was in the same situation as you just two years ago. I was more passionate about humanities than sciences and my O level grades made it clear that Im more suited for the humanities (straight A1s for humanities & languages and straight A2s for all my maths and sciences). Still chose sci stream in JC and oh boi, got straight Bs for maths & sciences but straight As for humanities and languages. So I truly understand how bad it can be when you‚Äôre forced into science stream. However, I wish that someone told me back when I was in JC that arts & sciences complement each other & just because you enjoy/excel in one doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the one is irrelevant to you. Just right before my A levels, I realised that I shouldn‚Äôt be all grumpy & unforgiving about being forced into the science stream, bc a science education can make my humanities essays sound more well-informed & in general, make me a more logical person (instead of a rambling fool who bases arguments on pure emotions). so, don‚Äôt get too upset when you get shit grades for sciences / when you have to mug for it, because all these sufferings are for a greater purpose - to value-add to your pursuit in the humanities/arts.', ""I considered joining the arts stream since i took double humans double science in sec school.

Don't lose hope.Keep us updated :)"", 'if i‚Äôm not wrong, they received the news about their interview dates on 31 march/1 april.', 'i was from poly so I kinda knew what I want or didn‚Äôt want so it was my only choice HAHA. people told me it was super risky when i could‚Äôve put more choices but i guess it was to show i really wanted it (???) hehe. i hope your family will be more supportive once they see how happy you will be in this profession :) can‚Äôt wait to see you and know you better too!!', ""HAHA, I chose nursing because I wanted to be involved directly with helping patients out too!   \nI am most likely going to accept the offer for Nursing!  \nIf everything goes well, I'll see you around in NUS thenÔºÅ"", 'thankyou!!! can i ask, you took the photo by yourself or go to a photobooth?', "":') Hope to see you around as my batch mate soon!"", 'I think you have to go to the NUS portal to check it out!', ""Thank you for the words of encouragement!! :)) I can relate to the part on convincing parents that Nursing isn't such a bad choice after all, especially given the current climate of COVID. Nursing never really had a good image amongst the middle-aged to older generation and there's some social stigma surrounding Nursing though thankfully (I hope) some of it is starting to be dispelled. I'm actually more of an Arts and Humanities kind of student so it was either FASS or Nursing for me. I have interest in Biology and wanted to take Pure Biology after Secondary 2 streaming but my school forced me to take Physics instead LOL\n\nI brought up the following points to my parents to reason with them and aid them in understanding why I eventually chose Nursing as my first choice over FASS:\n\n In terms of practicality and employability, a career path in Nursing is not only more stable but it pays decently as well. Furthermore, after reading through the modules I realise there's a moral ethics and social science aspect side to the field of study that I had previously overlooked and I do really like. In addition, a career in Nursing doesn't always require us to be on the front lines during pandemics or times of crises (I believe that is the part where it is the most concerning to our parents, since they tend to worry about our safety) and not everyone works at the quarantine facility, you could return to the research field of Nursing or become an educator in Nursing. Also, the Nursing degree itself opens doors to other career options where the relevant skills are valued. Without doubt it's one of the most meaningful jobs out there \n\n Yes hopefully we will see each other in Nursing next year. Do let us know how things go for you. Congratulations on your stellar A level results btw!! I did really bad for H2 Math HAHAHAH That was where I screwed up :')"", 'Hope to see you around too ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'I took by myself since I only need a soft copy. It‚Äôs a little harder to do tho cuz I gotta resize the image to their requirements, but u can use the app photogrid to prevent distorting the image ^^', 'yep i‚Äôve been checking it everyday but no replies haizz. guess i‚Äôll just have to keep waiting :(', 'Omg this is insane. I think we share quite a bit of similarities. My first choice is actually FASS & tbh even though I prefer nursing, a part of me upset that I will no longer be able to study my beloved humanities as much as I did in JC. \n\nIn secondary school, I had to take Physics instead of Biology because I wanted to take pure history and my school only offers it with physics. So technically, I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to take physics (but tbf I did enjoy physics lessons, my physics teachers were kinda quirky & adorable).\n\nUnfortunately, my parents belongs to the bunch of older generation who has yet to update their views. No matter how much I try to explain the different career pathways for one holding a nursing degree, their conclusion is always ‚ÄúAiya whatever lah, just don‚Äôt put it as your first choice if not <insert boomer‚Äôs view of a nurse‚Äôs job scope>.‚Äù\n\nTbh, initially I thought I would be okay if I got accepted by FASS. But after working in a clinic, my desire to pursue nursing grew - which kinda sucks since I think the chances of me getting into FASS isn‚Äôt low (sorry if I sound like I‚Äôm bragging) & I‚Äôm not too sure if you‚Äôre allowed to appeal to your second choice, if you were offered your first choice :((', ""OK keep me updated!   \nHope they contact you v soon! :')""]","[1586233617.0, 1586232247.0, 1586250645.0, 1586242065.0, 1586237788.0, 1586261716.0, 1586307978.0, 1586312573.0, 1586313325.0, 1586248089.0, 1586354802.0, 1586248144.0, 1586261407.0, 1586434983.0, 1586248202.0, 1586248224.0, 1586323875.0, 1586323912.0, 1586342299.0, 1586323996.0, 1586339606.0, 1586324080.0, 1586249334.0, 1586248533.0, 1586271133.0, 1586490863.0, 1586250559.0, 1586332233.0, 1586324199.0, 1586343855.0, 1586407538.0, 1586340030.0, 1586443378.0, 1586261734.0, 1586494514.0, 1586261296.0, 1586326887.0, 1586426807.0, 1586273501.0, 1586495139.0, 1586327391.0, 1586430234.0, 1586407427.0]","[10.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Plus points if you go for friendlies and tournaments. You can even win SP Sportsman/woman of the year, as my friend did! Having a CCA also gives you time to exercise, bc no more PE lessons HAHAH thats one thing i miss.\n\nBut im not gonna lie, its tough balancing that and schoolwork, especially if its a more project based course bc that takes more time. And if you need to go overseas for competition? Thats also tough. And dont forget sometimes your CCA days might fall on a day where your timetable is 8am-5pm, would you have the energy? I think its really balance balance balance of school/work. as cliche as it sounds. Just be disciplined, know when to take a break from CCA/School to focus on the other.

For my main course, i cannot speak much on revisions and exams bc i never had a single exam paper to take for my diploma. But i did take a Diploma+ in Psychology, and for that, printing my slides were a big help. I like to have physical notes I can refer to. For my revisions, reading back, then writing a chunk on what i can remember helps. (eg. ""Experiments, date of experiments, a short summary, any other details) Then I make a list of things i forgot to write about. After doing this a few times, there are things that i commonly forget and i revise those more. I keep doing this agin and again until i feel comfortable. Honestly this is just mugging i learnt from sec sch. Past year papers help ig you can get your hands on them bc tbh,, lecturers that i yave encountered really dont change much HAHAH\n\nFor projects tho, if its individual i try to do asap, bc consultation, though it sounds fking lame, really does bump up my grades after i take lecturer suggestions. If its groupwork, i try to do an itinerary for my group, likr what date must at least have what done, so we\'re linda on track and not last min. HAHAHAH\n\nBut also i put more emphasis on the modules that have higher credits.

I had a good experience w my course and i didnt regret joining, not once HAHHA so you add a nice course + my interest, i scored well. and my Dip+ was really enjoyable too! ngl i think my choice of not having a CCA was good bc it gave me so much more time to do my work, party, hang out and finish projects early. It was helpful that my course had our own personal studio so we had a place to do our work, store things, power nap etc etc\n\nI made friends from many diff courses through other friends/gen ed/events, and i got to go overseas 3 times for schooo trips or to represent sp (Taiwan, HK, UK)! My internship was really enjoyable too but i also got lucky with a great company and work environment. FYP sucked ass tho, client work is never easy, but it was a great score bc I ended up doing graphics for Legacy Fest, the one that replaced ZoukOut last year.\n\nOverall a fruitful journey.', 'Oh! For me I didnt have a CCA but still left with many friends from different courses. Firstly you have Gen Ed/SIP, common core modules that every student has to take. And from there, the students in each class come from different courses, so you can meet friends there! For me, I was in Visual Effects and my other Gen Ed half was from Engineering. \n\nYou can also do events! Like helping out with SP Open House, you see people come and go alot. Or if youre selected by your course for showcasing/overseas competition etc etc, thats another way. Personally, I had 2 overseas trips (UK & Taiwan) with students Events Planning Management.\n\nAnd you still have your secondary school friends! Or even Pri sch! They will be from different courses and parts of the school, so youll be running around meeting them for lunch, or saying hi as you coincidentally pass by in the corridors HAHHA\n\nBut also, cant deny that having a CCA is an extra boost for widening your social circle!', ""Hi! \n\nFor me i see both sides of having a CCA and i honestly cant make that judgement for you. I personally did noy have a CCA, so i had a lot of time and energy to work, club, party and mug.\n\nFor CCAs, pros are: Good way to expand social circle, A really good chance to score great points on your resume/portfolio with performances/competitions/overseas trips etc etc. The camaraderie you get from CCAs are super satisfying, and you get a big variety to choose from! And having something to look forward to really saves your mental health in times of need. Extra group of friends to meet and have fun with! Being limited to your own course can sometimes be stagnant and boring, a change of crowd is always refreshing.\n\nCons are: legit no time to do work, and sometimes you might hate the CCA but get pressured to stay. Or you can be so into the CCA that you forgo your diploma work. And for some CCAs, you need extra equipment, which means more cost. The commitment to exco, camps, events etc is high too, if you're in those. And if you need to go overseas to rep SP, youll have to miss classes and sometimes, precious revision/project work time.\n\nWho should and shouldn't join? Well.. there's really no formula for that HAHHA im so sorry i cant answer that."", ""Hi! (sorry this will be damn long paiseh)  My workload in dvemg was manageable, but im someone who had no other commitments outside of class. That means no CCA or interest clubs. Year one was actually really enjoyable and the modules were honestly informative, engaging and really interesting. Keep in mind that all of my work was project-based. So for year 1, it was probably the easiest year. Workload was about 6 modules? all concurrently done at the same time. Different due dates but all fell in the same week. sounds like alot but bc the work was simple enough, i could take on all 6 at once.\n\nYear 2 ripped me a new asshole tho LMAO like fuck,, the modules were intense. And my smartass decoded to take a Dip+. Scripting, Storyboarding, Visual Effects, Full productions, then Gen Ed, some 3D modules AND qe had an attachment with USS for the qhole of their HHN as makeup artists. so imagine your class starts at 8, you end at 4, rush off all the way to fking harbourfront, do makeup until 7pm. Thats every weekend for the whole of a month. Quite heavy and no time,, but tbh also on my end i was fucking partying twice a week so... HAHAH My gpa was 3.7 then. Good times! It was a lot of late nights in the studio, and all the deadlines would be intimidating if you didnt pace yourself well and put priority to the earlier due ones. But having your friends to slave away together really made everyrhing damn fun\n\nYear 3 ripped me another new one too, for FYP. internship was the best time of my dvemg life HAHHA, the work environment i was in was amazing, co-workers were great and i scored w a company that saw me as an asset, no a commodity. FYP THOOOO wow... client work is.. something. thats all i can say. my teammates and i died every damn week, deadlines were 4 days away from the next deadline. it was hell for 5 months. My year 3 semesters were day and night in comparison. \n\nTimetable wise, very chill. Like in a week, probably 1-3 full days, if youre lucky, your timetable might even have a free day with no class HAHAH The rest of the week is probably like,, average 6-ish hours? And because it's project-based, your deadlines are the week before MSTs, so you get one extra week of holiday when everyone is in school taking exams."", 'Elective modules are not counted into your overall GPA.  \nI\'m not sure what you mean by ""tutorials""... if you\'re referring to homework-type \'assignments\', it depends from tutor to tutor but it\'s generally counted as part of GP (General Participation), which in total takes up around 10% of a module\'s grade.  \nHope this clears your doubts.', 'Hi! A few things really! Firstly, it\'s a new environment, with new people, so everyone has no idea how everyone else is, personality-wise. It\'s easier to do something you\'ve never done like try making more jokes in class, answering qns more, asking for help more bc then people wont be like ""hmm thats so unlike you"". Does that make sense? \n\nHave lunch with different groups of people! Dont just stick to one group from the first day. Its easier to get into multiple social groups and cliques, as it\'s everyone getting to know each other so they really just take anyone in. \n\nEven from the different classes! If you have mass lectures, sit beside someone from the other class so you can talk and share experience! Or smile at people passing by in corridors, especially those you recognise or pass by frequently. \n\nSay hi to Foodcourt aunties/uncles!! theyre very nice and they love students talking to them, not just ordering from them. Ask them if they ate, or what time they started that day. Comment about how hot it is or how it keeps raining. HAHHA \n\nI\'ve already been a pretty outgoing person even before poly, but yes, poly did enhance my social skills. I learnt to approach people better, and make friends from wildly different backgrounds. Very fun time. Just go ahead and say hi on the first day! Because they\'re probably as awkward and as cautious as you are. People appreciate a kind, friendly face.\n\nHave fun in SP!', ""NAH fuck orientation LMAO i didnt go as well and it didnt put me at a disadvantage, socially. Did they say it was compulsory? Honestly there's not much they can do, consequence wise. Emailing them, you can, just to be polite! But it wouldn't really affect you if you informed someone or not. I think it's better to tell your orientation leader/GL instead, because they'll be the one doing headcounts, marking attendance etc."", ""Not that I know of. I wear shorts almost every day, and some wear even shorter shorts. I guess the only time it's recommended against is for safety or situational reasons - workshop, formal presentation/event, etc. The only rule I'm familiar with (I'm in EEE) being enforced is the covered-shoes-only rule in laboratory."", ""Thank you for the elaborate answer, I didn't realise that there is no more PE üòÖ yeah I guess there's no harm in trying it out first but what if I decide to quit?

Thanks so much omg', ""wow, thank you for the very long and detailed reply! it gives me some perspective as to what to expect in the coming years and to prepare for it. which modules were the most challenging for you? a bit OT but does storyboarding require an artistic skill in drawing? also, would the whole course go to HHN together for the entire month? year 2 seems like a very hectic year! i guess year 3 is where you get to put what you've learnt into practice? thank you so much again for replying and glad you enjoyed your time there!"", ""oh i see! my parents aren't letting me go cuz of the virus but the school said it's compulsory. thank you for your answer!!"", 'LMFAO this is such a mood. Honestly, I think it barely gives you a head start on friendships, maybe just general facial recognition. Only pluses I see are getting the free shirts from flag day and SFL.', 'Oh I‚Äôm in MAE so i‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs going to be somewhat similar haha thanks!!', ""hey no problem! From what i've experienced, probably about half yes half no HAHAH and yes! youre able to quit CCAs! You can defo join as many or as little as you want. But keep in mind that after committing for a while, it might be tough to quit, like for example if you were training for a competition, or rehearsals for a performance."", ""omg are you going to be in dvemg? Modules that were challenging for me was Creative Storytelling and Compositing Fundamentals. For CST you had to storyboard, script, shoot, edit and produce a short 5 min video. Group work. I died there. Storyboarding does not need artistic skill, it can be stick figures too. The one that needs artistic skill is a module called Draw, it's in Year 1. \n\nFor ComF, the software was just an asshole. tough software to get a hang of but very satisfying when you do. and most likely its this lecturer, jeff. He's fking funny and a friend. He tries to do this thing where he scares the year 1s by being damn strict, and he is. He will rip you a new asshole if you play around w him. But afterwards in year 2 he's chill as fuck, the most imo, out of all the lecturers.\n\nAnd yes! Whole course goes to HHN together. its a great opportunity to mingle w the other class. It was really quite fun. And yes! Year 3 is where everything comes into play. Though i will suggest not to take client work LMAO, not just my clients but every client for every FYP group was difficult. When you have your own personal project for FYP, its easier to make changes, stay motivated and generally have an easier time. But then again hopefully your group mates are manageable too! \n\nHey if youre gonna be in DVEMG, good luck! it was a great fruitful journey for me. I strongly suggest putting in the most effort in year one, be the most extra for that one freshman year, because the modules are easy enough to score good. The key to make your thibgs look nice? emulate styles you see on behance, instagram etc. DO NOT COPY, but take colour palettes, artistic influence from them. Texture overlays are your best friend too. Learn photoshop, C4D (3D software) and After Effects well, these will be the ones you use the most.Dont forgo things like class participation marks too. Grab every mark you can, because if you score low on class participation/resume submission etc, you lose an easy boost on your grades. then after having the good first year, just maintain it, dont have to improve if you cant, but just maintain that good gpa. bc most people play first then work later, bit its too late. once you lose that first opportunity its tough to get it back up to a good gpa in the next to years as jumping up 0.20 a miracle. most people just jump 0.02 tbh.

[A LEVELS] content overload for h2 hist,A Levels :snoo:,1586226566.0,hi i'm a j1 and i'm currently studying sea democracies and there're SO MANY case studies stuffed with so MUCH content. my tutors said that we would have to write at least 2 case studies per para for essay. can i have any more tips from yall seniors? thanks! ><,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fwcatt/a_levels_content_overload_for_h2_hist/,8,"[""I had the same problem last year. \n\nWhat I realised by promos was that there's no point trying to memorise all the case studies. Rather, you should try to organise the case studies into categories of a topic. \n\nE.g. Topic: military \ncategory: military in the government/military regime\ncase studies:\n\ncategory: military subservient to govt\ncase study: singapore\n\ncategory: politicised military but not in govt\ncase studies:\n\nThis way you can identify the case study that best shows a certain scenario and only memorise that one case study properly and use it whenever you have to write an argument on that topic.\n\nYou can also prepare stock arguments that are commonly written.\n\ne.g  military regime successful in terms of\n\n1. Point X + evidence\n\n2. Point Y + evidence\n\nmilitary failure in terms of \n\nPoint A + evidence\n\netc\n\nThis way you can pre-plan common arguments and use them to revise. Also reduces thinking time during tests. I had an issue of not being able to think of all the causal links fast enough during exam, but with this method I already know all the links beforehand and can just write them."", ""actuallyidk\\_ has a really good sorting tip, but also wanna remind you that for SEA essays you need to use 3 countries at least for each essay! So inside your essay you have to put in three countries worth. \n\nThis is important especially when questions include terms like 'post-independence' -> which immediately wipes out all of your Thailand evidence. \n\nIt's also worth noting that in different topics, different countries are of different relevance. A simple example is when you study the AFC. Naturally, Indonesia and Singapore are key because they represent the worst hit and the least badly hit. So, it's good to have a good grasp of these two to start. Then you pick other countries by point: So if you are looking at an AFC causes question, and you want to talk about the trigger event of currency speculation, you will look to Thailand and Malaysia -> two case studies for one point. But, that doesn't mean you need to study all of Thailand and Malaysia. Like actuallyidk\\_ has mentioned, a category you go for next is 'weak macroeconomic fundamentals', so you learn more from the Thailand side to combine with your in-depth knowledge of Indonesia. \n\nAnother good tip to have is of course to see the links in your topics - eg how nation-building and multiculturalism/assimilation affect economic prosperity and later stability - and how all of these are tested via crises like the AFC - after which the type of govt may impact the responses to the crises, and how the people react afterwards. Building the links really helps with the memorisation side."", 'Hi! You can DM us on Instagram @01step_at_a_time and there‚Äôll be someone to answer any of your questions!', 'exact same experience in j1 that made me want to give up on SEA honestly LMAO. what worked for me was write out essay outlines for different questions, and i found out that there were some case studies that can be applied throughout a variety of questions. i just memorized those specific case studies and made sure i knew all of them very very well. then i moved on to the ‚Äúlesser used‚Äù ones haha', ""Yes, this is actually quite useful to do. Another way to look at it is to 'study by question' in which you focus on what evidence and details you want to use for each case study in each argument. Of course its also important to note that you may end up not using a lot of the nitpicky details in your notes (because you prob won't remember them) but you must definitely remember the details that help you make a case/further your argument. \n\nOne way to make it easier to remember details is to rewrite the notes in your own style and you can make it more concise by categorizing it by argument/question. Rewriting is generally helpful for memorization, and writing it in your own phrasing might help you remember it more easily.

[META] PSLE Math Rant,META :redditgold: ,1586186585.0,"I posted this like a month ago but it got removed but I checked and it was still on so I was like whaaat. Anyway...

No, I am not taking PSLE this year, but something far worse. My cousins do and they always ask me for help mostly in Math. This has probably been reiterated many times. But I just wanted to rant about something I feel needs to be addressed in the primary school education system. In this particular case, it's for PSLE Math. I don't know why but it's just too difficult to solve those damn questions, especially without the use of simultaneous equations. For me, that is the challenge, doing questions with those god damn models and explaining it clearly to my cousins. 

It's time-consuming for me to think about the questions, and I presume it's worse for them. I remember my upper primary days being stressful and thinking I was stupid for not being able to answer those questions. I remember my parents paying for tuition that tried to teach me simultaneous equations, but I didn't know how to apply. See, I feel like if simultaneous equations were taught earlier then those kids will be less stressed out and have more fun in school.

I've seen people in JC getting 210 for PSLE and even some Normal Acad students excelling in H2 Math and even taking F Math. All I'm trying to say is that PSLE is one of the worst exams ever and I hope the syllabus changes to be a bit more advanced because algebra makes everything super easy. And as seen in secondary school, all algebra takes is a lot of practice to master, and not having to UNDERSTAND confusingly-worded questions and solving using MODELS. 

My hope for this rant is that more people, especially 12-year-olds and their parents, don't see PSLE as life defining because that shit is TOO hard and if they work hard and smart in secondary school everything will work out.

But I guess that's how MOE identifies IP people."", ""LOL I also still can't do psle math whenever I see assessment books in popular"", 'Math is not about solving the question and getting numbers. MOE is teaching math in a way that forces students to THINK, analyse the problem and draft up an appropriate path to the solution. I strongly believe this is an integral part of education and it should start young.\n\nWhat I really hate about is secondary schools and JCs teaching math mechanically. You see equations and numbers, you don‚Äôt see the meaning, you don‚Äôt see the relevance, you don‚Äôt see why the concept of introduced in the first place.\n\nThe PSLE math questions presents a problem, and uses model to help students analyse the problem (visual learning). This helps them understand the motivation of mathematicians having to invent simultaneous equations, which is more abstract and not every student and understand.\n\nMost primary and secondary school children can solve simultaneous equations easily because you are taught to move numbers around mechanically. That‚Äôs not the point of math. In secondary school you are introduced to calculus, you learn how to differentiate, but have you learnt why the concept of limit was vital? Have you learn how mathematicians moves from infinitesimal calculus to using limits as a foundation? Have you tried to understand why the reverse of differentiation between two point - definite integral - is the area under a graph? Have you learnt why dx behaves like a number when it‚Äôs mathematically invalid to say dx is a number? You don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt understand math the way it should be . MOE is trying to have primary school kids understand math, not move numbers around.\n\nAs an NUS High student, I can clearly see why MOE is designing the curriculum to be that way, because my curriculum require me to think deeper and my exposure to other curriculums in other countries made me understand how they approach math education (ie Hungary) \n\nHungary didn‚Äôt outperform Singapore in PISA, but Hungary‚Äôs math curriculum is said to be one of the most beautiful and elegant; and students understand and APPRECIATE math at a deeper level. Think, why? \n\nAs with sports, math require practice, practice, practice. I cannot stress this enough. Knowing how to read musics notes on Paganini‚Äôs piece doesn‚Äôt make you a violin master, practicing and being able to perform it well does.\n\nWhat‚Äôs disgusting is not the curriculum or the questions being tough, is the\n1) expectation that everyone should be able to solve every question and the \n2) mechanical understanding of math\n3) Parents getting upset because their kids can not solve some problem\n\nYou just have you understand that \n1) Exams are NOT designed to have everyone score a 100%, if you can‚Äôt solve it given all the resources, you have to accept that you have much more to learn \n2) Singaporeans learn math for grades, most understand how to solve but does not truly understand why math is the way it is. 3Blue1Brown is a good example of what _understanding math_ is like.\n3) PSLE is not a major milestone in life, not even close. It‚Äôs only a measure of your academic proficiency at 12 years of age, nothing more. Kiasu mindset is ruining the purpose of PSLE. \n\nPSLE teaches a child more than just the academic content, it also let them taste how real world competition is like. Accept that.', ""It's a good thing that the use of things like simultaneous equations won't result in loss of marks. \n\n[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318214429/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2007/20070217.htm)."", 'Honestly I feel that the PSLE wasn\'t difficult, just tricky. From my own experience of taking PSLE and looking at other years\' PSLE Math paper, all the questions were able to be solved using the methods that the teachers taught from the syllabus, stuff taught from outside the syllabus only made our lives easier such as the simultaneous equation method. From what I saw in the ""killer questions"", those just required some out of the box thinking and looking things from another perspective sometimes. \n\nThe main reason that people seem to overlook is that PSLE is set by SEAB, while O and A levels are set by Cambridge in partnership with SEAB. The reason people find O and A levels simpler may be because Cambridge tests for understanding, while SEAB likes to test for the students\' ability to apply concepts. Take the circle question from last year for example. You can see that the question isn\'t difficult, it\'s just testing for the students\' ability to apply their understanding of units and parts, together with their ability to visualise that the two lines are equal. \n\nThere are always questions that are supposed to test your ability to apply, along with questions that test your understanding. This is how MOE differentiates (pun intended) the A students from the A\\* students. ""A"" students should understand concepts fully, while A\\* students should be able to understand the concepts AND apply them correctly. \n\nAlso, if you haven\'t noticed, these ""killer questions"" only make up a small percentage of marks in the paper, around 5-8 marks. Enough for people to go ""Aiyah! I didn\'t get A\\* cos of this question!"" which is ultimately the point of such questions, and it isn\'t the case where ""Aiyah! I fail cos of this question!"", because there are other, simpler questions that test for understanding which make up around 60-70% of the paper.', ""OP you literally said everything I wanted to say. And I'm still pretty appalled that model drawing is still a thing now, I thought it stayed in my boomer days.\n\nModel drawing and simultaneous equations not being allowed was what made me get C for PSLE math and eventually 209 in a cohort that's already very competitive.

Whenever i look at psle maths, i really wanna use algebra and calculations that i have learnt in sec sch instead of the stupid models. I found sec sch maths(e and amaths) or even jc maths(so far) easier than psle maths.

I feel like the road from PSLE to A levels, Math just gets way and way more dry and boring.', 'I get you mean, I am international students so I have to learn psle stuffs before entering sec 1 and I was suffering. I found sec 1 was so much easier and I think that it was because I actually had teachers to teach me sec 1 math whereas I had no teacher for psle math. Eventually, I took O levels and quite confident with my math as I scored A1 for both. Then, some foreigners asked me to help them with psle math because they are trying to get inside sec 1 here as well. I got to say, psle math is still bs. Especially all those words problem, like how do you even use models and ratios to solve ? I got so frustrated at one point and told them to just use algebraic method because it‚Äôs so much easier.

A lot of it just requires a ton of steps but for me just paying attention especially when learning about the use of pi and radius for area of circles is enough to solve those questions. Although maybe it‚Äôs just my experience, I found score A* in Maths relatively easy, honestly scoring A* in science is much harder because they ask questions that aren‚Äôt taught and requires out of the box thinking which isn‚Äôt usually taught in science since science is founded on facts and logic and not really on assumptions.', 'agreed. psle needs brains, practice and understanding while o level and a level math is just practice and understanding thats all', 'Good insight.

I know to score well in math u need to drill in hours and hours of practice but that‚Äôs just half the battle if you don‚Äôt get the understanding and the knowhow to apply it‚Äôs quite useless.

NTU just requires students to take lesser General Prescribed Electives (GERPE) and Unrestricted Electives (UE) to graduate, so the bulk of your modules are accountancy modules. \n\nAnd from my understanding, NTU‚Äôs accounting modules is the most in depth compared to NUS and SMU (the former being a business degree specialising in accountancy, not really an accountancy degree). Being a 3 year programme will definitely mean one less year for internship opportunities, but it also means one extra year of ACTUAL working experience ‚Äî it‚Äôs up to you to interpret what‚Äôs good.\n\nThe reason why NTU students have a lower starting pay than SMU/NUS is because a bulk of NTU‚Äôs accountancy graduates will go into Big4 firms (which colluded in their starting pay to be around 3k) so that‚Äôs that. It has nothing to do with the school‚Äôs curriculum.

Since young, I‚Äôve been forced to attend tuition and enrichment lessons as young as the age of 5. Could still remember how much I dreaded going tuition. At the age of 15, I had countless number of tuition classes and in fact I spent more time in tuition centres than at home.

Honestly I‚Äôve been very envious of those who have really close and good relationships with their parents. But well, it‚Äôs not going to happen to me...

However, there is a thin line between wanting the best for your child and forcing your child to achieve all the things you couldn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm not saying that you should outright rebel against every single thing he says. Instead, you should listen to him, digest his arguments, see if it‚Äôs relevant to you and make the final decision yourself. It‚Äôs tough and it takes a lot of courage to do so, especially since you‚Äôre still depending on him financially (I assume so?). But if this submissive attitude towards him takes root, it‚Äôll only be more difficult in the future. So, I‚Äôm glad that you went ahead with poly instead.

[O Levels] I don‚Äôt want to drop Pure Science because I want to go to JC (Arts Stream),O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586172066.0,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm an ‚Äòinternational student‚Äô (but I grew up here) currently Sec 4 taking the typical Pure Science stream. (Bio, Chem, Amaths & Emaths)

Mentioning that I was an international student was relevant because of the fact that I don‚Äôt take Mother Tongue. Instead, I take a 3rd language (French) which I‚Äôm currently doing very badly in lmao

With that said, that can only mean one thing‚Äîif I were to drop to Combined Sciences, it‚Äôll be nearly impossible for me to go to a relatively good JC unless I do extremely well for French. (I‚Äôm currently scoring an E8 lol)

I‚Äôm not doing very well in my Sciences either. I largely blame that on my lack of effort last year. However, right now, I‚Äôm trying much harder to push myself to score better and although I do see improvement, I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs enough.

I‚Äôve only started to buck up at the start of this year and I don‚Äôt think that the slow development in my grades is not a telltale sign that my efforts will be enough to actually do well during my O Levels. I wanted to use the upcoming Mid-year Exams to gauge how well I was coping with my newly reformed attitude (lol) but due to the COVID-19 outbreak, my plans were all ruined.

So now, should I...
- Drop Pure Science since I‚Äôm not coping as well as I should be & there‚Äôs no way to assess if I‚Äôll ever be able to cope with its rigour due to the cancellation of MYE? (Which would mean that to get into a good JC, I would have to do exceptionally well for my 3rd language which isn‚Äôt very realistic)

Or should I...
- Stay in Pure Science and continue to grind with no way to tell if I‚Äôm doing enough and just hoping for the best that I‚Äôll do well during Prelims.

Currently, I‚Äôm aiming for an A1 for both my English and Humanities and A2s for both of my Maths & in my Sciences to go to an Arts Stream in JC. (Yes, I don‚Äôt plan to continue with my Sciences if I were to get into JC) and if I were to score anything greater than 15 points, (raw score) I would much rather go to Poly instead.

I appreciate all of you for taking the time to read this long post. Thank you all!

P.S. Tuition is not a viable option for me. My family‚Äôs income neither earns too much nor too little. It is suffice and cannot support me if I were to go for additional tutoring.

I dropped to combined science after my MYEs last year. Combined science is so much easier... so if you‚Äôre aiming for a Low L1R5 score and not intending to take up any H2 sciences in JC, can dropp', 'Should consider what subject combi you wanna take in JC', 'I was from the arts stream (GELM) and in sec sch i did combined science! I doubt taking pure science is important at all especially since you know you want to go Arts Stream!

However, what if I choose not to drop and ultimately mess up my O Level aggregate much more than my French would‚Äôve? That‚Äôs really the biggest dilemma right now', 'Yep, But if I score perhaps a D7 (bare minimum for MT) for French while I‚Äôve (hypothetically) aced every other subjects, that‚Äôll still give me a 12 point aggregate. \n\nThe main problem is do I avoid French (which I know I will flunk) or do I take a risk and work for 2 A2s (which I might not even get?)\n\nEg.

I would love to drop to combined but I‚Äôm not entirely sure it‚Äôll improve my grade since it‚Äôll include French as one of the six subjects that make up my L1R5', 'Pure bio and chem are safe in the sense where pure memorization can get u a minimum decent grade(b3,b4) but as a language French has that lack of guaranteeable consistency.\n\nPersonally I take a non standard mt and have suffered with grades from D7 to C5 for mt. So I just gave up on mt and decided to focus on my sciences cause I prefer having  that sense of security.', 'The thing is now is only the start, as long you put in the effort, distinction is achievable. In addition, due to covid 19 marking may be more lenient and the bell curve may be lower/less steep as well. I mean you never knoee. Imo it‚Äôs up to you,it‚Äôs your decision...if you drop to combined science most probably you‚Äôll end up with A1. If you avoid French , which I believe language is rather harder to improve compared to Science you May also score distinctions for both your sciences if hard work is put in. You might also wanna think about why you‚Äôre scoring a certain grade for your sciences. As someone who dropped from pure Chem (F9) and pure Bio (B4) before prelims to combined science (A1 for Os) all I can say is that the diff between pure and combined chem is rlly huge. My math sucks so my pure chem suffered. Combined chem is more towards memorising and application (math is very minimal) so I managed to score well for combined chem. The reason why I dropped was bc I was sure I didn‚Äôt need science for my poly course (you might also wanna keep your options open for now, no harm considering poly) \nAnyways, you can think about it (whether for you it‚Äôll be easier to improve your sciences / French etc) then make a decision which to drop/avoid , I did have classmates dropping to combined sci / A Math even after prelims so yeaa...I also did have classmates who got B3/4 for both their sciences but dropped to combined science bc they knew they wanted poly and wanted a lower L1R4 for Os', 'ahh i‚Äôm sorry i must have misread it!! well i guess it rly depends how much you want to go to a ‚Äúgood‚Äù jc?

if y‚Äôall have any problems during hbl / just need some help for o‚Äôs i would like to help y‚Äôall !
i took triple pure last year for o‚Äôs ( double sci -chem & bio + pure geog ) , elect lit + ss , double math , chinese and eng ! 
i‚Äôm in no way a model straight a1 or 6 pointer but if u do need any help , feel free to hmu on telegram and i‚Äôll try help u as best as i can ! if u still don‚Äôt understand i don‚Äôt mind calling to explain it to u as well ! let‚Äôs all help each other in this crisis :) 
if you need a listening ear , going thru a hard time or even just need someone to talk to , my telegram is always open ! ü§© 
i just wanted to help the community & give back on this platform that helped me throughout my truly meme-worthy o level period last year üò• 
telegram user : mochiineko 
attached i have some studying tips as well for any who might need it ! 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
1. throw your phone somewhere , put it in airplane mode or if u have forest , use it !!
- trust me , all the texts / notifis rly hinder the revision process , i know you‚Äôve probably heard this a billion times but it does help ! if you‚Äôre someone ( like my dumb self ) who needs google , mute all the social media apps ( or if you‚Äôre on apple , lock it w screentime !) and limit urself to use it solely for school !
i have friends who also asked their parents to confiscate their phones  üò•üò• but i wasn‚Äôt gonna do that to myself LOL
2. notes are actually useless .
TRUST ME IT SOUNDS STUPID BUT notes are only useful if they are YOUR OWN ! we all learn / digest knowledge in our own ways , so unless the note set is made by you to cater to your own knowledge gaps / parts u struggle understanding , it‚Äôs a little useless ( unless u have photographic memory ;-; pls teach me how ) ! so ! even it takes a whole lotta time to make ur own notes , i feel it‚Äôs p worth it if u uds what you‚Äôve written ! if you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôve written , highlight those parts out and ask questions or review them !  if you lack time / spend too much time making such sets , remember that ur notes only need to be KEY POINTS and not the entire textbook, condensed :( , aNd it doesn‚Äôt have to be pretty ! ( ok shoot me cos i love making pretty notes but if they hinder you... pls don‚Äôt... i promise u can make them pretty if u have time !)  ( also if you‚Äôre a visual learner BONUS POINTS cos u can draw out diagrams ! if you‚Äôre not ... I HAVE MORE TIPS )
3. YOUTUBE VIDEOS 
oh yes, i have many teachers who ! don‚Äôt ! explain ! well ! so what do i do ?? go on youtube and search for videos that explain such concepts ! i loved using crashcourse for chemistry & amoeba sisters for biology (bonus is teded but i usually watch it in my free time LOL) it also rly helps bcos of all the animations 

‚Äî‚Äî
i have many more tips that i can‚Äôt think of at the moment but i will compile a google docs when i have more time ! 
i hope i have managed to help any of you out there :)

[Scholarships] CN Yang Program & NTU CS vs Nanyang Scholarship & NTU CS,Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1586162784.0,"Hi guys, I am currently having a dilemma here and want to hear from different perspectives. I am looking to specialize as  a software engineer perhaps specialising in the fields of Machine Learning and AI. Was offered NTU CS with regular Nanyang scholarship or CN Yang Scholarship program with CS.

Pros and Cons of CN Yang Program that I can think up of:

Pros: Provides for alot of opportunities, networking chances and prestigious (Not sure about this wrt companies). Research experience might prove to be useful in the fields of AI and Machine learning.

Cons: Learn stuff such as triple science etc during the first sem, might fall behind other cs students and career wise (Because these modules are very heavy in content wise = spending less time on cs mods and less free time for personal projects). Also curriculum wise suggest that uni breaks will be spent on things like making & tinkering etc = Less time for self-sourced internships, and less elective slots.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvv8cl/scholarships_cn_yang_program_ntu_cs_vs_nanyang/,0,"[""Hello, CS + CN Yang student specialising in AI/ML here.\n\nFirst let me address some of your cons. Yes the first semester has triple sciences but I feel that it has not resulted in me being left behind at all. In fact I'm actually happy to have the triple sciences modules because they are practically in place of UEs and as long as your foundation from JC is there, you will do more than fine. Imagine getting free As and A+s from just knowing your JC content + a little more, pretty good deal to me. \n\nIn terms of modules compared to other CS students, you will be behind by around 2 modules after semester 1, but you can make up for it if you overload the next semester. If you are caring about personal projects and career at this point, there should be no issues with you knowing your CS basics, so all is fine.\n\nOnly the first year's summer is spent on M&T and you can see M&T as one of your personal projects too by incorporating your major into it (which is what I'm doing). Usually companies do not want Year 1 students as interns, so that internship clashing with M&T should not be an issue. \n\nAs for the pros, I'll talk about them from my point of view. Taking the multidisciplinary Year 1 was actually really enjoyable for me because I got exposed to so many different perspectives that aren't just limited to CS. I got to see how CS, and more specifically AI can fit into all the different disciplines and in this day and age where literally every person without an interest is going into CS and planning to specialised in 'data science', having these small edges of knowledge can be a very good advantage over the average CS graduate. \n\nMy research experience so far has been very enriching, cause I got to explore an area of ML which is rather new and there are very few people out there who actually work on it, and NTU has one of the few research groups doing it. To some of my friends, going straight into AI research is kinda like baptism by fire, for the lack of a better phrase, but it gave us a lot of valuable experience that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise until what is probably Year 3 or 4.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of the other pros of CN Yang like the close knit community and all, so I shall not expound on that. \n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to message me :)"", 'May ik what your rp is', 'How did u manage to get the general nanyang scholarship also when u hv alr gotten the cn Yang Scholarship?

[poly] a rant,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1586161989.0,"hello im not sure yall have came across my posts on reddit regarding my admission of poly but i previously had an issue with my enrolment and ranted it here. true enough RP admission office had completely forgotten about my enrolment. called them multiple times but their replies were not helpful at all, sent many emails but did not received any reply. 

long story short, i know a lot of RP students also facing issues because they did not receive any information or received different information from the majority.  

im actually really pissed off at the admission office because they called us back for an induction programme this week and they have not told everyone the time slot they were allocated to...thats like so last minute and theyre making everyone anxious zz. 

eventually most my problems were settled and i‚Äôm just waiting for a final email before i can configure my laptop. 

i have compiled all the different stories of people having bad experience with the people in RP. you judge for yourself.

[ story 1 ] : this girl called the IT dept and was told to school because she was experiencing some admission problems. when she got there, they took down her contact details and they told her to go home and wait. wasted trip. she could not do anything else but to wait.

[ story 2 ] : my friend applied for dae to school of applied sci. a week after the scheduled interview dates, he received a call from rp saying that they missed out his email, and will arrange an interview for him soon, as well as sending an email to notify him by the last day of march. you‚Äôve guessed it, they did not contact him ever since.

[ story 3 ] : this girl had problems with her laptop after configurating it. she gave rp a call and continuously for 15 mins the staff told her to factory reset her laptop, and this girl insisted that she already tried doing so but would not work. the call ended after she argued with the staff. the next day she went to school to solve the issue.

[ story 4 ] : another girl similar issues to mine and she called the office this morning, the staff told her that they will send an email with regards to her configuration of laptop by today. its 10.26pm and you know whats the outcome.

i can confidently when two people call the office and they ask the same questions, they will receive two completely different replies. im not the only one having a bad experience. 

these few days my contact with rp admission office left me speechless. there was not a point in sending them emails because they simply dont bother to reply unless its extremely urgent. they would also missed out some student admissions, but i dont blame them for that because theres alot of people applying. 

one thing they did unforgivable was that they dont send emails or sms by the deadlines, and when they‚Äôre sent out its super last minute. i understand that they sent it out by batches but i think they need to be more efficient. its quite stupid if they send out notifications last minute.

my biggest worry is that they will forget to send me the email for laptop configuration, and i would not be able to seek help because there would be no one in the office as they staff may be working from home. it might caused me to not be able to access the apps and complete my hbl, thu affecting my grades. in the event if this actually happens, i swear im gona give them Hell. im so tired of their nonsense.

[O levels] Dealing with feeling inferior,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586158903.0,"I feel so demoralised and tired after seeing students from elite schools getting straight As despite them being from elite schools, meaning their papers are more difficult/rigorous.

I don‚Äôt know why but I just feel so overwhelmed, like everything is piling on me. 

I‚Äôm getting no where with my studies. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm already losing sleep for studies, I‚Äôve already did whatever I can, but it‚Äôs still not enough.

It‚Äôs not my fault I learn slower , not my fault if my mother tongue is not English(haish english......),but yet I‚Äôm bearing the consequences of them.(Ok I sound unreasonable and whiny, I just really need to get this off my chest.)

This general feeling of inferiority, jealousy and even contempt towards myself is slowly taking a toll on my emotional health and grades. I find myself blaming genetics(omg eww I‚Äôm sorry for thinking this üòî) and being very pessimistic towards life in general. I know this mindset would definitely not serve me well in the future, and hence am trying change.

How do y‚Äôall deal with this feeling?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvuh9x/o_levels_dealing_with_feeling_inferior/,13,"['is okay to be a slower learner \n\nas long you dun give up on yourself. everybody can say you cannot or you no good but you cannot give up on yourself. \n\njia you :) anyway can PM me or check my profile for my study exp.(I am a slow learner too)', ""Hey there! I took O-Levels last year and all I can say is that you should never give up. I suffered from burnout and depression at the start of sec 4 which made it really hard to focus on my academics as I often found myself digressing into self-doubt and fear of losing out to my peers. \n\nHowever, it was through this that learnt many things about coping with negative emotions:\n\n1. Don't push the blame - regardless of whether the situation that \nyou are in is your fault or not, realise that heaping guilt unto      yourself or others will do Nothing to solve the issues you face learn to ignore such sentiments and focus on your work.\n\n\n2. There is hope as long as you don't give up - Things may seem\nbleak right now as your world may burn down around you. Still, its\nnever over until you decide to give up. As long as you remain focused and motivated to press on through the pain and doubt, your effort WILL show in your results.\n\n3. Learn to enjoy the process - As difficult and far fetched as it may seem, learning to develop a liking for the process of preparing for O-levels will make it easier to cope with the rigour of doing so. I had a friend who is now in an elite JC who used to practice A math everywhere he went, even on the school trip we went on after our exams in sec 3 on the food tray in the plane! To him, he loved practicing as he knew his every effort would pay off which is why he no longer saw it as a burden to practice but instead a part of his daily routine. (He finished the Amath paper 1 in ~40mins so that practice definitely helped)\n\n\n\nSo here are some things I have learnt in secondary school which I found worked for me in preparing for exams in general. I hope that you find out what works for you and succeed in implementing those strategies.\n\nHere's wishing you all the best for O-levels and a memorable journey with the time you have left in the run up to it!"", ""Well... There are late bloomers. There are people who are contented with simple life. There are people who don't mind working harder to reach their goal. \n\nI guess it depends on what you treasure, and whether or not you can take some hardship. I didn't start off in elite schools as well, my secondary school results were shit until I put in effort, and as long as I'm happy with my family now we're ok. Nothing about those high flier to get jealous about. \n\nSo, maybe ask yourself truthfully, what is it that you treasure? And whether or not you need to rethink about what you treasure?"", 'Don‚Äôt have to compare yourself with others. You are what you are. Some people are just great at studying. Some are great at sports. While others are jack of all trades, master of none. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI‚Äôm really proud of you for trying your hardest. Set a mini goal for yourself to achieve, such as getting a grade higher from your previous test. Then, reward yourself for it, such as buying a gift for yourself etc. \nFor me, I find studying with my close friends more effective as they would encourage me and just have fun while learning. \n\nIn life, It‚Äôs a pathway to becoming the best version of yourself. Exam results do matter but you would have no regrets that you already tried your best. Again, comparison does not help at all and it will only cause unnecessary stress and pressure for yourself. Thanks for reading and I really hope you think through this.', ""Yo i was a slower learner.

However, i realised tat every1 hv their own strength n the 'elites' see me as equal since the start ( but they were my pri sch schoolmates whos was in thr first class ).\n\nRight now, im gr8 friends w them n we had grind out TYS tgt during o's. They even ask me when a question is cause them problems and smth i was able to solve it.\n\nIm a vry competitive person, so i couldnt stand bein so far from my elite friend in terms of grades, so i work even harder n i end up matchin them at o's standard in Chemistry, Amaths,Emaths and Biology.\n\nTL;DR : Feeling Inferior is not a bad thing as it drive you to catch up to them but do not let the feeling be a reason to give up."", 'Tbh the bell curve will be in your favour,most elite students would have gone to the IP stream already', ""Don't blame yourself for being a slow learner.

You just need to find that out because that will help you boost your confidence. \n\nWhen it comes to studies, there are some subjects in which we are weak but there are also some which we are good at. You just have to put more effort on those subjects you find hard. \n\nWhen you study, plan it well. Schedule in such a way that in a week you can cover all subjects. Make sure not to overwhelm yourself when studying. Take one topic at a time. Make us of your lifelines when you can't get it in your own...maybe from your friend who is really good at it or from a tutor. When you finally get it, make more practices especially if it's problem solving. After mastering it, then you move to the next topic. \n\nYou can do it! We all have are different moments to shine.

[Uni] Is SUSS or a uni in Kaplan better?,University :snoo_smile:,1586145126.0,"Hi! I‚Äôm really stuck now because if I get accepted into SUSS, I don‚Äôt know if I should accept it. I don‚Äôt know if I can get into other unis and between SUSS and kaplan uni, which has a higher employability rate in Singapore? Please help me with your honest opinions üò£ SUSS and kaplan uni students would be a plus so I have a clearer understanding. My arguments are:

1. SUSS is a 4-year course while the same degree in a kaplan uni is a 1.5-year course.

2. SUSS is mostly self-based learning and students don‚Äôt go to school often as compared to other local unis but pay about the same school fees.

3. A kaplan uni degree is just for completing the degree while at SUSS there‚Äôs overseas exposure, internship, and CCA to hone skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvrnpj/uni_is_suss_or_a_uni_in_kaplan_better/,21,"['I‚Äôm not familiar with either but I‚Äôll definitely choose SUSS as it‚Äôs a government uni. \nUnless I can‚Äôt get into my dream course in SUSS then I‚Äôll consider doing it in Kaplan. \n\nHowever, I‚Äôll prefer SIM GE to Kaplan as it‚Äôs a more reputable Pte Uni. The courses are normally 2.5 to 3 yrs. \n\n1.5yr for a degree course is too short for anyone to gain enough knowledge. As an employer, I‚Äôll doubt the value of this degree. Sorry folks from Kaplan. Just my personal opinion.', 'Here‚Äôs my opinion, as someone from a technical discipline in a standard 4 year local uni, with a pretty fast paced curriculum. I don‚Äôt have much knowledge of SUSS or Kaplan, so take it with a grain of salt please!\n\nWould I have considered myself to be ‚Äòhire-able‚Äô material 1.5 years in? Definitely will not be considered for any full-time position, qualified for internships (but will be fighting for it against everyone else). Simply put, I think it‚Äôs rare for someone to be able to develop meaningful competencies in 1.5 years to be competitive in the job market. So SUSS would be better of the two.\n\nOf course, if you‚Äôre looking at social science courses, the above may not apply.', 'SUSS. But it really depends on what you are looking for. Do you want to fast track your education and get to the workforce faster? If yes, then Kaplan would be ideal. \n\nOh but you mentioned about other unis! Is the date where  you have to accept/reject the course coming soon? If not, maybe hold on for a little longer ! You never know what will happen!', 'I would recommend you look into your prospective employers and cold call/email them and ask whether they will accept a Kaplan University degree.\n\nWhile the others have shared that a 4 yr experience at SUSS might be more comprehensive and the degree is more recognized, at the end of the day, IMO the main purpose of the degree is simply a piece of paper to get you into your desired job. Reason being that workplace experience is far more important than whatever the university teaches you. Especially when it comes to SUSS which does not necessarily offer the experience of a traditional university but is *IMO a degree factory (similar to Kaplan university) IMO* for working adults to obtain certifications hence the ‚Äúself-study‚Äù reputation it has.\n\nSo long as that degree fulfills that function (and seeing as you will save a significant amount of time at Kaplan granting you more time to advance your career), I feel that it is totally a logical option to choose Kaplan with the qualifier that the degree is recognized by your prospective employers which it should be for most private sector employers. \n\nCost should also be weighed into your decision though I think they should be about the same.', 'Suss because its a local uni and they make sure that u have experience overseas and compusory work attachment which makes it easier to find jobs in future', 'SIM , SUTD....better choice...Both SIM UOL or RMIT...very reputable...But SIM UOL is 100% exam based and some companies prefer UOL degrees.I have friends grade with UOL degree and working in the foreign bbank.But tough because is 100% examination based...', 'Definitely suss, its recognized as a local uni, can secure jobs faster', 'Definitely SUSS.

Spam tys and do 5qns of each topic ure weak at. Eg after i finish a tys i just pick 5 hard looking differential eqn qns from the topical book my sch gave me', 'Got 90 rp in PCME.

There is always a set format for dealing with Chem and Math questions that will come to you like breathing if you do enough practice.\n2. In econs memorize the different answering formats for Demand and Supply and Market Failure especially. It is a guaranteed way to get full marks for 2 out of the 3 essay qns you have to do. For Macro econs essay just choose one you are the most comfortable with but the format for Macro is more varied.\n3. If you have to do note taking, you should use an active format of note taking. Write down the questions that are relevant to the parts you‚Äôre highlighting and ask yourself those questions and recall the answers from memory', 'how do you manage ur note taking? like after each chapter ends? How long do u spent on it? And how much to note? Also, theres so many practices given, how should I utilise it for the best output?', 'So ur general study plan is like chapter completes, do notes and do lots of practices? How should I be doing my revision and notes in J1, if you can go back in time?', 'Ok thanks for the advices!', 'for bio I do it after I‚Äôm done with the lectures + tutorials for that topic. for chem I OTOTed and just wrote notes whenever I was free since they were quite short! math summaries I just did after each topic. econs I did after 1-2 chapters (I tried to keep up but sometimes because I was busy, I only did notes after the sch finishes the chapter) \n\nFor practices, do what u r weak at. For me, I was rly bad at MCQs for chem so I spammed it. Then I started doing the structured qns when I was more familiar w the content :)', 'Different study methods work for different ppl tbh so i think its best for u to find out what helps u the best.\n\nThe best method for me was to \n1. Listen in lecture \n2. Summarise chapter into a cue card (for math) or 1 mindmap (to recap for chem)\n3. Tutorial and testpapers\n\nSome ppl could not pay attention in lecture and self study but idk i learn best through listening so i made sure to pay attention. \n\nFor chem, some of my friends worked better by hardcore memorising the notes PLUS writing their own notes but my memory was terrible so i did a mindmap once to look over what i needed to know and basically never referred to it again. Then ""memorised"" through just doing qns and test papers. \nIf you have a better memory and notes help you link concepts (which is super impt in chem) then do it!\n\nFor math i think everyone spams qns but what rlly helped for me was to try finding my mistakes myself. So i\'ll read the 1st line of the solution and compare with my answer. Then when i find the wrong part i stop referring to the solution and try to continue from there.\n\nDont try to force a method that seems like the best but if u wanna give my method a try then by all means haha, good luck!', 'Alrites!

For physics, same thing try learn using lecture notes and practice with TYS. For economics, it depends, might want to start doing essay questions or even CSQ if Macro or Micro is already fully covered.

The amount of time you study is not a good indicator of how well prepared you are and how able you are to get an A1.\n\nFor subjects like math, science & POA I instead feel that a good gauge is finishing practice papers well before the timer ends and getting very high marks without checking for carelss mistakes, i.e E math paper 1 is 2 hours? Aim for almost full marks in 1 hour. Careless mistakes are weeded out with practice and a calm mental state (a must have for Os!)

It's a tricky one, read model essays (and examples if u do argumentative) or read random descriptive words and have a vivid imagination if u do personal recount/descriptive essays. As for Paper 2, just keep grinding papers until u can get a high mark that is beyond the A grade to be safe.

Underline keywords and sentences to help you understand certain parts of the text, and if you have to expand on certain parts of the question (especially for essays), do it. No one is stopping you.\n\nNot only that, try reading up on various topics in the news, or if you're more adventurous, read up to gain further knowledge about the topics that really interest you on wikipedia, forums or blogs. You may never know what'll come out in your actual paper. This gives you content to use for your essays, in the form of examples and points.\n\nLastly, I feel that this may be underrated, but fortify your foundations on the technicalities of English. I know that using flowery and bombastic language ie. 'I serendipitously stumbled upon my long-lost cousin at the market yesterday.' can attract the eyes of Cambridge markers, but without a decent foundation in English, there's no use for a thesaurus. Study and know the rules of grammar, like which prepositions and tense to use by heart, such that it almost becomes like a reflex when you do editing questions. Try aiming for close to 0 grammatical errors for every essay you hand in to your English teacher. Only then can you try being a bit more creative and explorative with your writing style. \n\nIt may sound a bit daunting, but with practice, it is possible to achieve all of this.\n\nTl;dr: understanding of the text, reading up more widely, and strengthening your foundations are what will help you score your A1."", ""The hours should not be your gauge though you need to allot time for each subject.  \n\nWhat you need to do first is prioritize your subjects.

Any other people who did arts subjs welcome to join :) I hope that even though there are no more MYEs for you all, and this coming moth of HBL, you will stay motivated and study steadily without burning out. This is such a new situation so honestly, can't blame you (and don't blame yourself!) for being anxious. Good luck!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fv71xg/a_levels_willing_to_try_and_help_if_people_on_hbl/,15,"['From a HELm:  just want to ask for study tips? \n\nHello! Wow okay, study tips are a very broad and general thing, but for the arts subjects, need memorisation, understanding and speed. \n\nFor history - make sure you analyse a lot of past year questions, get to know what question means what: ""to what extent"", ""do you agree"" ""evaluate"" ""was more important than"", all these have different nuances to the number of minimum points you have to write.\n\nFor history, I\'d say, uh, you can specialise but please, no spotting. (Cambridge threw us a Secgen question and first decade, then also no AFC) \n\nFor everything in general, I\'d say know what makes you motivated - for me, I like reading fiction, and watching dramas, then outdoors things I like to look at plants -> When I feel like I\'ve done enough work, then I relax to reward myself. This gives me something to look forward towards and makes studying less tough.  Also, try to do work consistently, don\'t spam papers because you can burn out, making you lose more time than if you just went slow and steady.  \n\nNext, I tried to clear all my content problems by mid of the year, talk to teachers, friends, re-read notes and relearn concepts if needed as early as possible. This is because if now, while practising you cannot do one topic then suddenly the panic sets in and you\'ll freeze up. Mark out beforehand the things you are not so good at, spend more time (eg . math OMG vectors please relearn it fast fast,) \n\nDo also remember to breathe. Yeah. Feels like a mad dash, but really a lot of things will be up to fate. Make sure you know your things all the way to the bottom.

Still, I feel that the best sort of literature revision is just reading and re-reading your text. Unfortunately or not, h1 has fewer texts, so less to shuffle. I would rotate my texts, reading the ones in the same paper together in the same week. \n\nEsp for H2, your text comparison requires you to draw links between your texts, reading them back to back helps - do it until the point where you can imagine words in one text appearing in another in your dreams!\n\nAlso would advise not highlighting/underlining until you have a solid system in place, so you won't regret or have a messy book that you don't understand later on.

Cannot understand the source/misinterpret (also important to note if you have more problems with which type -> the text chunks, cartoons, stats) 4. Not a \'rigorous\' analysis 5. Not enough skills shown? \n\nFor the ck side, one of the best things you can do is get exposed to a lot of sources - there are many things the sources can show us that the lecture notes may not get around to covering. The first thing to do is to get your hands on the school prelim paper drive (link is floating on Reddit I believe) if your teachers haven\'t given. Because the ck for the sources will only be a tiny bit of all the content that you are going to be learning. \n\nRigourous analysis means being able to go beyond just paraphrasing which is usually enough to pass as long as you write quick! One of the best skills for this is ironically not your CK, since when we do papers often sucks that the CK we want to use appears in a source inside the set they give us!! Instead, the best skill is the cross-reference. Because the skills only need to appear once/twice for you to move up the band (like from L4 to 5/6) you need to display as many skills as possible. \n\nBest to find sources that pair well (usually from the support set one will directly contradict the challenge set, or be an academic article about the exact same thing, etc lots of possible relationships) after you prove the reliability of the first half, cross-reference back to that one while writing about the next. Eg. A, B, C are reliable (finish) Then in the challenge set reliability evaluation \'Source E says ...."" CR to source A, which is an academic discussing the speech in source E, reveals to us that the political considerations of the speaker in E make it less reliable...\n\nAlso, just practise a bit!! more, need time to develop the flair and sometimes gotta get lucky and be hit by inspiration about the source - like not just \'academic source\' but \'this institute is actually funded by the government\' - not just \'retroactive analysis\' but \'the anniversary of the event\', not just \'after the cw so the archives will be opened\' but \'this is the person recanting their earlier statement because now they are no longer in power\' \n\nIf you know your part a is fine, when doing papers don\'t need to waste time, just jot down the similarity, difference, explanations, don\'t need to write out in full when doing prac. Only do the whole paper if you have time, or if you need to practice all.', ""More on help with lit paper time management:\n\nFor time management during lit paper, usually we try to go by 1 hour per question part -> but this actually can translate into 15 minutes of reading all the questions and planning at least a bit for all the questions you intend to write. \n\nThis is so that you have 5 mins per question at the very beginning as well as 5 mins just before you start writing to plan in-depth your topic points (with evidence/quotes cause sometimes you write then DANGIT cannot find your quote then ded need rewrite), before the 50 minutes of writing your essay. \n\nAlso idk how scientific it is, but I've always felt doing the beginning thinkythink helps me kickstart subconsciously thinking about the later questions, so I'm warmed up by the time I get there"", ""How to structure your study plans/More general study tips:\n\nHmm studying in general really depends on you. Want to just say that I did super bad for my promos (needed to take supp paper even), but I managed to make it by putting in consistent effort. So no matter how badly you did, there's hope okay!\n\nFirst look and rank your subjects, then in each subject rank the different topics - know where you are weak in, what content, what skills, and focus on those.\n\nWhen you get demotivated, then practice something that you know you are good at to boost your morale - the amount of time you will spend on each subject really depends on how much that subject needs help, relative to your other subjs, but I would say it's good to touch all your subjects every week\n\nBest not to leave things untouched (eg. don't mug econs until no time to touch history, or do so many math papers until you toh and don't wanna read econs notes) cause the subjects can become a 'different language'\n\nThis is particularly true for Arts kids like us, because even though all our subjects are essay based, the kind of writing History wants, versus Econs, versus Lit is very different! :') I think it's self-explanatory that if you're doing CSC, CSE, CLLit, ELLit, Geogh, that they are different writings. So, even if they are your best subjects, don't forget them -> in fact, use them as 'reward motivation'."", ""Tbh, not really! There was no fixed 'format', but like you just write stuff and then go to your teacher supervisor to have it looked over. However, you can write with reference to either samples that your supervisor shows, and according to the h3 history syllabus doc.

It's sometimes fascinating to find the little things that the paper is designed to do, especially the Learning Outcomes which did actually push me into thinking harder about my topic.\n\nThe most plain format I can think of is:\n\nIntroduction, \n\nLit review (expansion of the one you did briefly in the proposal), \n\n\\[start of content\\] -> maybe about two/three headers on points you are doing research, the multiple answers/facets to the historical question you created, \n\nconclusion (where you should be tying up any loose ends/synthesising as well as weaving in the limitations that you originally identified -> this good to link to a future possible avenue of research to show that your question itself doesn't just stop, but provides even more possibilities in understanding the historical context and motivations. \\[end of content\\]\n\nacknowledgements are always nice, I feel, \n\nand finally bibliography, and appendices. \n\nBut really, the actual wording and structure depend heavily on your topic. Background-problem-reaction (with analysis inside) would be the summary of my paper, I did a geopol topic. If like eg. my friend did socioeconomic/dev. or one senior did art (like drawing art stuff), your topic headers may be more of context-issue-key figures-controversy-public reaction stuff like that.\n\n If have more questions, can pm!

I know this period is quite tough and many of you guys may not be able to stay on track with studies and may succumb to laziness so during this period I‚Äôll be doing daily uploads to hopefully keep some of you guys on the ball :)) Once your school‚Äôs zoom classes are over you can always tune in to one of my videos to double check on your content knowledge!! 

Do check out my channel and give it a sub and like only if the content helps you!! Also, I give out free consultations and will answer any question, so you can either direct them to me on reddit or via the YouTube comments section.

Uni engineering courses typically have an average IGP of 3.6 in the 10th percentile and 3.95 in the 90th percentile. However, i did not join any CCAs at all (such as ambass/society also) and is not planning to in the span of my poly life. I was wondering if anybody was in the same situation as me and still managed to go to NUS/NTU in particular because i know that engineering courses might be competitive and a lot of people might have a high gpa, hence it might ultimately boil down to portfolio :')..... My classmates and lecturers also kept telling me that i might not be able to enter NUS/NTU due to this i just feel extremely disheartened..... But, i really do not regret not joining a CCA because i had more free time to do the things that i want and rest more too.

[Uni] SMU/NUS for pursuing MBA in the States at a later stage,University :snoo_smile:,1586025939.0,Hi! I'm confused between choosing SMU (SOA) and NUS (Biz) for undertaking my undergrad degree.

3. Assuming I got to take biz with ppga, will I be able to get a job in either related industries? Or will biz just be seen as a value add to my PGPA major (since I still get a single degree) so I can most likely only pursue a career related to PGPA?

[poly] not posted into poly despite enrolment,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585995831.0,"hello its me again. previous post was asking on behalf of my friend. apparently everyone received an email and or sms sent by RP to notify them that theyre supposed to attend the induction programme next week, however i have not received anything yet. also i‚Äôm starting to worry that rp might have accidentally left me out.

as i withdraw from jae and accepted my course in dae, the enrolment portal was opened again till end of march. i have accepted the course, submitted the compulsory documents, and done everything that was needed. when my laptop arrived, i tried to configure it, however im stuck at the very first step because they said my student id doesnt not exist in their database. so i emailed the admission office for help and i was told that the email would arrive on 30th March, and i should asked the IT department for help if i still have a problem. its been a few days and i have not received anything yet. so i sent two emails to both the admission office and the IT department regarding this issue. today i called the IT Department, and they told me the issue lies with the admission office. so they passed the message and i have decided to give the admission office a call on monday morning, and possibly head down to sch in the afternoon or the next day to speed up the process

for the past few weeks, a lot of rp students have received a sms telling them that they can apply for a concession card at transit link website. i again did not receive anything. when i tried entering my ic number into the online portal, transit link told me that my data was not found in their data base. i have also emailed rp admission office about this issue.

can i just check if anyone is in the same situation as me? or you have been in this situation before? is it possible that i might have been left out? i have a friend who was told that the admission office forgotten to send him an email for his dae interview, and he was supposed to receive the email by yesterday but nothing came.

[UNI] My SIT Kira Interview experience (Radiation Therapy),University :snoo_smile:,1585997059.0,"Hi! I have just completed my SIT Kira Interview. While the experience remains fresh in my brain, I have decided to post what I have went through in order to help people who are going for this soon.\*\* Before my interview, I read through a fellow person's post about the SIT Kira Interview experience. It was a very thorough post and helped me a lot so I **will not** be repeating what the person has mentioned.

* It was 18 questions for me. The first question was not a question because the system just needed you to place your ID (NRIC / Passport) next to your face and say your full name out loud.
* You **do not** need to be worried about the sound quality of the recording. If the sound quality is bad, the system actually knows. The system would ask you to redo the question immediately. (It was like that for me at least!)
* For point no.2, I finished the assessment at 12p.m. sharp today. At 2p.m., they emailed me to ask me to redo the first question. That was because they could not confirm my identity for some reason. So please do **check your email** even though you finished the test already. This is important especially for the people who are only going to do this right before the deadline.
* There were scenario based questions. Unlike what I expected, the scenario based questions were not based on events that would happen in the hospital. There were a total of **two scenarios** but **four questions.** Both questions were not based in a hospital setting. Both scenarios gave me a position in the community (e.g. Grassroots leader) and a random situation and wanted you to roleplay. You play two different characters in the two different scenarios.
* There were quite a feel **what would you do / how do you feel** questions. Apparently, they said in the question that they wanted to see how people deal with adverse situations and difficulties. For example, mine asked me how I would feel and what I would do if I failed an exam and my scholarship was going to be taken away. Additionally, I had ""financial difficulties"" and how I would react and how I felt about this.
* They actually do ask you what you would do if you do not succeed in getting into this course! (I was totally not prepared and probably screwed this up)
* I was not prepared but please think about **someone** who influenced you a lot in your life (link it to your course). OR An **event** that has influenced you a lot in your life.
* Lastly, I would like to encourage all of you to be careful when doing this test. I have realised that when writing the 30 minutes essay question and when you are preparing the answers to the questions, the green camera light for macbook is still on. I went to do some small research and found out that if the green camera light is still on, the camera is still on. I am actually **not sure** if they keep a recording of you preparing the answers to your questions, but I am just asking all of you to be as careful as possible! Don't do anything weird that you wouldn't actually do in a face to face interview ok! (If I am wrong about this please let me know because I actually sneezed in front of the camera accidentally hahaha)

I hope this might help someone along the way! All the best to you if you are going to do this interview soon! I hope you get the course you want ok!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/furlve/uni_my_sit_kira_interview_experience_radiation/,12,"[""Hi, big thank you for the post üôá\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I'll be attempting thr interview tmr and Can I ask \n1.

Disclaimer: This is MY experience. Everyone's experience is going to be different because I don't think they are going to ask the same pre-recorded questions. However, I do hope you take something from this post. 

Tips:

1. Prepare your NRIC or Passport or 11B
2. Say your FULL NAME into the screen for the FIRST question while holding your identity proof
3. Look decent. If you are a makeup-wearer, put some light makeup on! The sun is actually right opposite me so in front of the webcam, it can reveal your imperfections. 
4. OPEN GOOGLE. YOU WILL NEED IT. TRUST ME. 
5. Fake confidence and make it believable. You will be nervous because you don't have a lot of time to research
6. Do your best! 

Interview:

Disclaimer - These are MY questions that I received. You might receive different ones and I will not be held liable if anything were to change or it feels like I short-changed you. Use these as a guide of the level of difficulty

1. What is creative accounting?
2. Why do you think it is important for accountants to upskill with the introduction of technology? (something like this-ish)
3. Do you think that RPA and AI will replace accounting jobs in the future?

Sorry I have like no gc left after A Levels but came across this question so I just give you general tips for this question:\n\ni) There are two parents, one at the back and one at front - and there are 7 remaining children. The order of the children matters, so you find the number of PERMUTATIONS of these 7, then multiply by two (because you can reverse the parent order for any of your permutations)\n\nii) You have 3 sisters, so you CHOOSE 1 of 3, and then consider the parentsisterparent group as one person for you to permute the new number of (2 sisters, parentsisterparent, 4 brothers) 7 people and finally also multiply by two (because again, can reverse parents order)\n\niii) Seats are indistinguishable means the seating in a circle formula (n-1)! or (n!)/n depending on which form you learn, they are the same -> basically, if they were in a line, you would do the n! but because the seats in indistinguishable, you divide by the n number of seats. \n\nThe 'no two brothers' makes you think of the slotting method, I found that drawing a circle with the number of seats helped me. So you have to 'fix' the position of the brothers, the 4 of them, and then you 'slot' the five remaining members in between them. This is a bit more difficult to visualise, but I found back this website that helped me while I was studying! \n\n[https://doubleroot.in/lessons/permutations-combinations/circular-permutations-examples/](https://doubleroot.in/lessons/permutations-combinations/circular-permutations-examples/)\n\n(no affiliate links lol just good learning resources.)

[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,:redditgold: MUST-READS: University :snoo_smile:,1585974513.0,"I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I‚Äôm not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (third choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don‚Äôt shame me, it‚Äôs fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there‚Äôs literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people‚Äôs portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler ‚Äì 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard ‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore‚Äôs/the world's best architectures and what makes them good.¬†Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‚Äòcan multiple hierarchies coexist?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?‚Äô and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question.¬†It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you‚Äôre trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‚Äòabstract‚Äô while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

[https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu](https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn‚Äôt want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‚Äòhm! Good enough‚Äô. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‚Äòis the first one from an anime?‚Äô and ‚Äòwas the third one a class assignment?‚Äô and ‚Äòwere the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?‚Äô (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‚Äòwhy do you want to study architecture?‚Äô and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn‚Äôt really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‚Äòso why is archi your third choice?‚Äô and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they‚Äôre applying for Uni.

[O levels] Am i too ambitious?,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585969892.0,"Hello, I'm sec 3 and I'm currently taking english, math, chinese, comb chem/phy, geog/ss, poa and fnn. I wouldn't say that I did well for all my subjects for WA1. I find that math, poa and fnn are the easiest for me to score a distinction but I'm not that good in my languages, I'm good in chemistry but I'm kind of struggling with physics which kind of frustrates me and honestly both my geog and ss teachers just can't teach (im sorry ;-;) I'm making my own notes for geog at the moment since my school doesn't give any notes for geog, and honestly I'm not sure what to study for ss other than just memorising the format. Im planning take amath (and maybe pure bio) as a
private candidate but I'm currently not doing well in amath, self studying amath apparently doesn't work well for me as I only know how to do the basic questions (sigh), I don't really want to turn to my math teacher for help either and my friends don't really have the time to help me as they are also busy. Pure Bio is not going so well either but I managed to do my school's paper and passed, should I start making my own simplified notes like geog?

Why do I want to take a math and pure bio?
Well it's because my aim is to go to a top tier jc and im planning to go to the science stream and I've seen that you require both pure science and a math. 

My aim is to get 6 points for o levels and I'm currently getting like 18..
Does anyone have a suggestion on what i should do? Should I just stick to my own subject combi or should I continue? Should I aim for something more realistic and just aim to go for a more easier to get in jc? I know being ambitious is good but I'm afraid that if I aim too high I might actually fall and be disappointed with the end result. The students in the better classes taking pure in my school aren't even aiming for something I'm aiming for.. 
I've told some of my friends about my aim, they don't seem to believe that I can do it either and my teachers don't seem to think I can even make it to a jc and told me to just go for a poly instead since its my level.. Am I being delusional?

Other subjects can be improved easily, maybe with the exception of humanities (notes)', 'For A Math reading the textbook for me is the worst way to try to understand the topic. I tried to study ahead at end of Sec 2 by reading textbook and I could also only do basic questions. I found that having a teacher explaining the basics to you really helps, so you should consider that, or look up some videos on the topic you‚Äôre working on on YouTube.\nAs for being too ambitious, I think it‚Äôs ok to aim high, and I‚Äôve heard that even the Sec 4 prelim results don‚Äôt determine your final result. However, i think it is better to focus on the subjects you‚Äôre taking in school first, and make sure you‚Äôre good at them before trying to study other subjects.\nGood luck!', ""Hey actually I took the exact same subject combis as you in olvl but that was 2 years ago so I'll try my best to think of some advice(this is coming from my own experience fyi).\n\nThe best thing to do now is to work on languages, try to use any tips from your teachers and understand the passages/write your essays, mainly cause you cant flunk your languages since you're aiming for jc. \n\nFor physics you can always break down your topics into 2 types, either formula or content, remember the formulas and understand key points and you should be able to apply them to your papers. \n\nIf you can do well in fnn, you can do well in geog especially in the lmq they are basically the same just with different content, as long as you have a grasp of key points you can pretty much bs through your answers. You can memorize content for GI from tb cause answers just come from there but try memorize other stuff from tb theres too much. I have to say this, do not topic spot, for olvl only select topics come out and it's really risky to topic spot cause you can get fucked. \n\nFor ss, really all you can do is understand and memorize the format and for srq same thing have a grasp of the key points and bs through you should be good.\n\nIt's really possible to have a good jump in grades, especially since you're in sec 3, just put in the effort and work hard. Since you already know you can get distinctions in some subjects, focus on the weaker ones rather than jumping into a  new subject that you're not sure you can well in.

J2 test results

I‚Äôm currently a J2 and honestly though my school doesn‚Äôt have MCT (or those block tests most schools had during march), we did have lecture tests etc for around every 3 chapters for each subject. 

I‚Äôm still doing alright with most subjects (I take HCME), but my math results... 

I got 6/40 for my math test on complex numbers, integration and DE. 

I know i shouldn‚Äôt feel disheartened and should continue to keep trying, but I just can‚Äôt help but feel that I can‚Äôt improve in time for A levels. 

I‚Äôm also worried of telling my parents about my grades for math (especially for this test) because I‚Äôm afraid of them being upset. I‚Äôll probably have to tell them soon since Parent teacher meet is on 8th may for my school, but i just can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to do it.

[A levels] school closures,A Levels :snoo:,1585965299.0,I am taking Alevels this year. I can‚Äôt really study at home. How am I gonna survive 1 month? The HBL wasn‚Äôt even that good for me and I prefer lessons in school. I am quite weak in all my subjects. Anyone can give me some advice on how to study during this period? Really worried because I didnt even do well for bt and now I don‚Äôt even have mye to see how much I have learnt.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ful90l/a_levels_school_closures/,139,"['You can face time friends/ classmates while studying? They‚Äôre purely there to motivate you cuz if you physically see others studying you feel more motivated to study too. If you‚Äôre too shy to ask just search up ‚Äústudy with me‚Äù videos on YouTube, there are livestreams and 6-8 hour videos of ppl legitimately studying', 'hello! j2 here with science combi (physics). personally i have always preferred self-studying to lessons so heres my take on how to be productive with studying alone! some of these may be obvious but yea here goes:\n\n1. choose a good place in your house where you can sit and focus. have enough space for writing, a glass of water, and youre set. no need to be super neat (i am never)!\n\n2. listening or not listening to music is your choice, personally i find that on some days for some tasks the ""demand"" for music is different. when you are trying to learn new content or use your brain heavily (e.g. for math), i think no music is more likely to work better. but this is your personal preference! take some time to figure out what you need\n\n3. if there are videos, it is not necessary to watch them. coming from someone who has not watched a single tutorial/lecture video from my school (for any of my subjects), i find that it can be very slow to watch videos and learn, also easier to get distracted. instead, try to read the notes independently and attempt the examples. if you really need solutions to guide you through and there is no pdf solution (reading is definitely faster than watching), you dont have to watch the whole video! just speed to where the whole solution is, copy it down, and figure out independently why it works this way. this helps long term understanding than just watching and copying ! (ithink)\n\n4. dont wait to ask! at any instance where you are stuck on one question and have been thinking about it for a while, that is the best time to ask your friends or teachers for help! when the problem is fresh in your mind and you have thought about it, that is the best time to look at the solution and it is a lot easier to internalise what others teach you then. if you decide to put the question off, not only will you have to relook at it when you next ask, but you would not be fresh with all your thoughts when you receive an answer, which is less effective for learning.\n\n5. discipline! you dont have to study everyday for ten hours if you dont feel like it, in fact dont study when you dont feel like it. (without school i sleep for twelve hours a day and study for any amount of time between zero to ten hours inclusive, and hey im doing fine in school, so dont stress about not studying ""enough hours""-- theres no such thing!) i mean discipline as in you maintain focus and productivity when you decide to study, and dont let yourself off until youre done with your tasks. no matter how fed up you are about it, keep yourself there until you finish it, and you can relax better afterwards.\n\n6. working smart is better than working hard, take this time to try things out and work out a way which works best for you. for the two months before a levels, youll probably have to spend lots of time studying on your own, so its good to start trying now!\n\njiayous !! you can do this (:', 'For me, I just take out my water bottle and leave it on my table.

If you do that part well, you‚Äôll be offered art teaching fully subsidised by MOE for the course duration otherwise it‚Äôs the regular payment\n\nIf you‚Äôre singaporean who‚Äôs overall family income might be staggering a bit, you‚Äôll be eligible for MOE bursary which would cover about half the cost ($1-2k+). \n\nOther option is to get scholarships. Can only get 1 once a year. The school isn‚Äôt very competitive and getting one in my opinion is not difficult if you top your own class. They cover 1 year worth of tuition fees which is darn good knowing that you‚Äôd still spend hundreds for art materials. Min 3.8 gpa score for 1 semester and overall 3.5+ cgpa to get one based from my experience.\n\nFortunately, the other route to art teaching is to directly enter NIE. I‚Äôm not sure about entry but while I was at the NTU gallery for art teaching, I talked to a mother tongue teacher who switched to teaching art so maybe that possible? \n\nHope this gives you some idea to plan financially', 'The fully subsidised cost is when you sign up a bond of 5 years with MOE right? It seems like applying through NAFA and applying through MOE is diff given that their application dates are diff.. I do not want to be bonded but is that the only option to avoid paying full fees of a whopping 19k?', 'The thing is applying with MOE actually lets you have the qualification to teach in schools unless that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want because the whole point of art teaching is to teach at schools. But not everybody gets it you know, only the best art students can get the fully subsidised option. An ‚ÄòA‚Äô for O levels might not even let you pass the MOE interview. They used to combine the interview with MOE but I think a change of system happened. I really think the bond is a super good option to secure a good job that lets you teach at secondary/JC after a couple years of experience. NAFA sadly has no follow up degree course for art teaching also.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to teach art classes outside, you can do that but it is not advisable in my opinion. Other diploma like fine arts and arts management can do the same. The students on their internships did teach children. There‚Äôs a thing with pay differences in the industry and the students were getting paid peanuts during their internship. If you‚Äôre going to cover cost with awards, you‚Äôd have to fight these people for the awards since they‚Äôre talented.\n\nAnd lastly I‚Äôm not going to suggest working part time. You can‚Äôt do that at NAFA. Absolutely not. Best option, study study study and sign up for the annual awards', 'Hey! Thank you so much for the well thought out reply it is very insightful.

Had a feeling it was the discussion that wasn‚Äôt good. Instead, she just got the scholarship and did fine arts. She did receive the non-subsidised offer but no point since she wanted to teach at schools. The art medium for the portfolio has to be somewhat basic. Oil paining, charcoal, pencil sketches, acrylic painting, clay sculpting (much less) etc stuff suitable to be taught at school.

[A Levels] should i drop out because of covid-19?,A Levels :snoo:,1585921668.0,"
im not ready. it‚Äôs fucking terrifying. 


i took BCME in my first year, then switched to HELM. i don‚Äôt regret the change despite not taking most of the arts subjects, in fact im doing much better. in j1 i was doing fine with 60 rank points (average A B Cs) and i thought i was finally on the right track with matching aptitude in the arts, maybe 2020 would be my year? 

well .. apparently not. IF i had graduated w my batch i could‚Äôve avoided this whole situation. due to covid: all subject teachers have closed consultations, even online chats like zoom are limited to 15 minutes bc my lit teacher has a 7 year old in the house. 

i didnt expect this at all.

my results have also all dropped and im hovering around S es despite so much hard work. especially h2 history and h2 lit.

ASR hasnt given ONE sample essay for history, and for h2 lit i really dont know where to start. 

these are my books: p1 (TGG, playing for time) and p3 (woman in mind, virginia woolf, regeneration)

i shouldve known ASR wasn‚Äôt a arts niche school, hell, we have one lit teacher for the whole h2 cohort. (p1) i hear of other schools getting so much resources but asr hardly gives any. we dont have homework every week aside from the occasional paragraph.

its been almost 2 years, we‚Äôre supposed to be gearing up for As but its just not happening. maybe im the only one feeling this? 

im studied hard, went in ASR with 9 points but my school really has to step it up on their lit department. there is no structure and every lesson feels like im being cheated of my grades. i keep trying to write essays for my teachers but they just keep putting me off. dont know what to do honestly üò≠üò≠üò≠ ive already wasted one year and i just want to get my grades. its really tough being a repeat bc theres so much pressure and stress that you have to do well. im pretty healthy mentally but the waves of anxiety are really making me sick

[A Levels] HBL is probably gonna make me rot at home,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585912263.0,"JC has been pretty hard on me. 

When I first stepped into JC, I was pretty stressed about a bunch of stuff, such as my choice for subject combi and cca. After that was settled, I began stressing out on my academics. I took combined science in o levels and have taken up 2 h2 science subjects in JC. I became stressed from the big jump in difficulty and depth of the topics, and there were stuff that was only taught in pure science that the lecturers assumed we knew about and I had to figure that out myself. 

But one of the reasons I am still persevering on is my friends in my og and class. They've been making JC life way more bearable and enjoyable and I always knew that they were also in the same boat. 

However, because of HBL today, I hadn't had any interactions with them, besides them asking about HBL matters. Moreover, I am a peripheral member of a clique I am in now, and I only talk to them at school and they'd normally do stuff like facetime without me (they're actually really nice ppl and I have nothing against them, I just haven't reached that level of closeness in my friendships with them compared to them with one another, don't misinterpret it as exclusion). 

And often times when I'm alone, a lot of negative and insecure feelings would cloud my thoughts and I'd often mumble deprecating things about myself. And given that HBL will start daily from next week, I have become worried about my mental wellness as I'd probably have very little interaction with my friends. There have been articles about how cases of mental health issues in people have spiked on the first day of lockdown in the UK, and I'm worried that my mental health will further deteriorate after the full HBL has been implemented. 

I don't need anyone's pity or sympathy or anything like that, because I just wanted to vent out my feelings.

[A Levels] Senior's Advice,A Levels :snoo:,1585909944.0,"Hi! In light of this whole HBL thing, I want to offer some advice taken from what I went through. I'm a senior who took A levels last year. One thing that's vv important to note is please don't get carried away and slack. In my J2 year, I took things free and easy even up till June holidays, then I realised I had much less time than I thought I did. (As in, I didn't study during June at all.) 

Yes, for those of you who are struggling in school for personal reasons or anything and are really happy about being able to ""take a break"", go ahead. Take the time to recharge. In fact, I do advise that everyone should relax. This is to prevent burning out. 

But do also continue to keep up with the syllabus and start your revision! I heard that mid year might be affected... as in cancelled. If this really comes to pass, it would mean that you'll only know how much you know at prelims. You don't want to go into prelims getting straight U's. By then, it'll be pretty hard to do well due to the time constraint.

Many people do not have the self-discipline to keep up with their studies even as they are attending school (not taking initiative to clarify doubts with the teacher etc, not doing homework, not listening in lecture). Fewer will have the self-discipline to bother with their studies in this season of quarantine. But remember that consequences await for whatever choices you make. I know quite a lot of people from different JCs who didn't do well (some are retaking right now). I also have friends who U-turned (drop to J1 during A levels) because they felt they weren't prepared enough. Not doing well for A levels is a very real reality for everyone. The reason will differ for everyone but do you really want your reason to be because you didn't study hard enough?

Eventually, many people do come around to trying hard when the A levels near. Sometimes, it's when they see their mid years. Other times, it's when they see their prelims. In this context, there may not even be a mid year exam and to wait for prelims would already be too late. My friend U-turned 30 days before A levels. He gave up before he even took the exam. A levels is a mental war and you don't want to have a self defeatist attitude and worse, it's justified because you KNOW you didn't study hard enough. My point is, there comes a time when there's a point of no return. Now is probably not that time yet. But that time always comes without us knowing.

By all means, take your breaks. Enjoy your hobbies. Spend time with your family. But don't use this quarantine season to run away from what you fear because problems aren't solved that way.

Support is also pretty important! You should probably continue to keep in touch with your classmates and friends because even if you aren't close to them/don't like them, you guys are still going through the same thing and it helps to not feel alone. If you don't mind, you can also talk to your teachers as well! You should probably talk to them about how you can complement your own learning.

PS: I probably sound pretty harsh because I'm the idiot who slacked and I know more people who are disappointed with their grades than people who are happy with them. And I know many people who are lazing around despite saying ""oh, I want to be doctor"" and it just doesn't sit well with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu622b/a_levels_seniors_advice/,32,"['i second op‚Äôs post i slacked till june too and paid the price when my myes were so shit had to work rlly hard to get back on track sometimes i will wonder how things will be different if i hadn‚Äôt slacked', 'Hehe thank you for the wise words!!

Never be complacent, always be prepared

There were signed petition for school closures.

Every student and teacher had a chance to go through Home based learning. Loaned out many laptops and WiFi to students who don't have. The exercise this week went smoothly. 

It is now time to move to full home based learning. 
From Wednesday, 8 April onwards, Home based learning until 4th May. 

Required to stay at home. 

School remains open to those who need support.

Exams: Do away for all mid year school exams. National exams are still essential and will continue.

O level MT exams will proceed. Year end exams no need to worry for now.

Marking will be adjusted to be more lenient and can apply special consideration. 

Student Care: Remain open for parents who need support with all the health measures in place, thermometer and etc.

Uni: All exam and homework assignment at home

Poly and ITE: New batch of students, first years, come to campus, register and get equipped for online learning. Students will be coming in small separate batches for the next few weeks. 

Advice: Try to learn outside of syllabus, find the curiousity in you and learn what you are interested in during this time (lol)

Stay safe, stay home, stay curious.

[O Levels] Scoring straight A1s in Secondary English and N/O Level English -- Paper 4 Oral edition,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585900214.0,"In this discourse today, I will be sharing some tips and tricks to study and prepare for N/O Level English Oral. Often, students are at a loss and do not know where to place their focus on for English Oral. As such, they often go into the exam with barely any preparation. In 2020, the syllabus for English Oral has changed -- information is now presented in a video format instead of a singular picture. Furthermore, many students are worried because the oral exam has been postponed as well. However, with the correct preparation technique, I believe that English Oral is an accessible component for students to score well in.

1. **When your preparation time starts**

10 minutes is not a lot of time, if I do say so myself. However, it is sufficient time to prepare for both sections if the time is managed well. Usually, I will allocate 3 minutes for the passage preparation. Read through once, and sift out the areas that emphasis has to be placed on. Don't dwell on the passage for too long as you will require more time to brainstorm for the spoken interaction. Watch the video very closely. 2-3 times would be advisable, and take note of every single detail. After watching the video, immediately start to brainstorm on your ideas and key points. More explanation on preparation for this part can be found below under spoken interaction so i will not delve into it here. 

**2. Reading Aloud**

""You can't prepare for reading aloud. Just go in and read the passage."" This is a common misconception that many students have. Due to our overuse of Singlish and sometimes, lousy English teachers \*cough\*, we get overly accustomed to pronouncing a certain word in a certain way. Fluency of reading is not difficult, hence examiners often pay extra close attention to the candidate's word pronunciation. Let's start with the most commonly used word, 'the'. If the immediate word following 'the' is a vowel (meaning AEIOU), 'the' is pronounced as 'thee'. However, if the following word is not a vowel, 'the' is pronounced as 'th-uh'. This is just one of the multitude of pronunciation errors that students make in the examination. To prepare for reading aloud, make a habit of searching up a BRITISH DICTIONARY (not American!!!) for the pronunciation of any word that you may be unsure of. I can't be listing down every single word here, but try to make a compilation of commonly mispronounced words and practice reading them out loud individually, then in a sentence. When reading, aim to make the words flow. Don't just look at the word that comes right after, look at the rest of the sentence that follows a particular word. This can make a difference especially when you have to decide which word to place more emphasis and stress on. You may think that it is a little too late to say this, but try to incorporate accurate word pronunciations into your everyday conversations. Correct your family members and friends when they pronounce a word inaccurately. It is the little habits that we can correct to make ourselves more proficient at the language. Another important thing to take note of is articulation. Pronounce all 'th' 't' 'k' well, reading each word slowly. DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PASSAGE. Be careful when pronouncing words like 'tests'. Articulation will come easier when the passage is read slowly, but be careful not to undermine the areas of the passage that require emphasis.

3. **Spoken Interaction**

Students' biggest fear. The key to this section of the examination, as many students don't realise, is to let yourself go and just speak. Even if you are shaking with nerves on the inside (i was too, don't worry), just calm your outer appearance and pretend like everything is fine and dandy. There are ways to prepare yourself so you can be much less nervous on the day of the examination. If we were to take a look at the ALL the topics Cambridge could EVER come out with for an oral examination, how many are there? If we narrow it down into broad categories to ease our preparation, I can only come out with a handful. Technology, Arts and Culture, Family, Money, Transportation, Health, Ageing Population, Education. These are practically the only few broad categories that they could ever test you on. So based on these broad topics, prepare a handbook of recent news articles and stories. Take a look at the 2019 O Level English Oral. They combined technology and education, asking about the use of computers for education. From here, you can start doing some research and reading up on how technology has influenced education in recent years. You could even bring up how tuition centres and schools have been using online platforms to teach during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Or talk about the regular Home Based Learning days that schools usually implement occasionally. With sufficient examples prepared, you can then move on to weighing the pros and cons of using these means. e.g. ""Yes, these online learning platforms are beneficial as they facilitate independent learning, training students to be more self disciplined to complete their tasks without having to go to school. However, it can be detrimental as the lack of supervision could result in students slacking off, procrastinating more, and may not be effective in educating them."" You could also talk about how technology is expensive, and students from lower-income households may not have the means to purchase a personal laptop for their studies, especially when there are multiple children in the same household. By drawing out a mental mind map of this thought-flow process, you will be able to, with practice, come out with points very quickly. With more practice, you will get the gist of the kind of possible questions you may be asked in the examination based on these broad categories itself.

Another method I found extremely effective is to hold conversations with people. I often converse with my mother, asking questions like ""What do you think of the government imposing a sugar tax on food and beverages with high sugar content?"" Conversing with others will help you widen the viewpoint and expand your horizons, giving you more alternate perspectives to a certain topic. This is especially helpful for those who have difficulty coming up with points to talk about. Garner as many different opinions as possible, so you will have an array of ideas at your fingertips.

Lastly, I must emphasise this. Good use of vocabulary is extremely paramount in spoken interaction. It adds colour to the point you are trying to bring across. I have mentioned how to improve your command of vocabulary in my previous post for paper 1, so I won't delve into it further here. However, an extra tip for English oral would be to come out with key helping phrases for yourself. For instance, one phrase to describe transportation would be that it 'forms the backbone of every nation'. With these key phrases, it will be easier to actively recall some possible points to answer whatever question the examiner asks. 

be calm and stay confident in yourself! don't let your nervousness get the better of you and just remember to articulate well in the examination! feel free to ask anymore questions that you might have and I will try my best to answer them as soon as possible. :"")",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu46ns/o_levels_scoring_straight_a1s_in_secondary/,21,"['thank you!! you have any tips for summary ? thanks:)', 'henlo!! this was super super helpful, thank you :‚Äù) is it alright for you to  make a HCL edition?', 'There are four lights!', 'yess!! i will cover when i do the paper 2 section :‚Äù)', 'ok to be very honest you can consult me on every subject that i‚Äôve taken except hcl because i‚Äôve not scored well enough to give advice HAHAH', 'im a little confused what lights HAHA', 'ohh that‚Äôs fine!!!

 I want to study education/drama. (Yes I know NIE is an option but I do not want to be a school teacher. I want to do something different.) I spent the last 3 years working in a student care and loved it. Now I want to take private a levels this year. Brand new.
I came from Poly but my GPA was 2.85. 24F this year. I am a linguistic person and like humanities. But due to some family problems my grades suffered from O level till poly. For O levels I scored A2 for English and B4 for Combined humanities. Yes, I know it's not stellar. But I'm older now and I am more focused. Another plus point is i can pick the subjects I'm strong in. Problem is....I know it's competitive. You have Raffles and other top JC students all competing. And I'm just a private candidate. And I feel quite old already. So question is, should I take this route?  Because i know I'll study hard. I'm just afraid I'll be discriminated against because I'm not from some top JC or even in a school. If not my other option is LaSalle Musical theatre because I hope to be a performer or a drama teacher next time. The other more ""practical"" (but not that passionate) option would be SIM BA communication/international relations.

Apart from what everyone else said, JC subjects are challenging to study and get straight A‚Äôs for even for students from top tier JCs. Even in those schools not everyone takes 4H2s. People who score 6 points raw in Olevels or IP students from top tier secondary schools still study for whole days with teachers‚Äô guidance and school resources and might not even get straight A‚Äôs. JC subjects are nothing like Olevel subjects (Olevel subjects barely scratch the surface, even more so if you got a B4 in combined humanities and want to take h2 geog in JC) and they‚Äôll be even tougher if you have no guidance at all and have not been in the habit of studying in a long time. It‚Äôs not the type of content you can just memorize like Olevels, you have to really understand everything very well especially if you want straight A‚Äôs. Idk if you know this but amongst JC students, Geog and Bio together is considered a suicide combination because they are both the most content heavy by far and by that I mean stacks and stacks of lecture notes that you have to memorize, internalize and apply. And practical is 20% of science subjects so keep in mind you have to know how to do them well for Bio. I apologize if this sounds mean, but when you say you are certain you will study hard and you are more focused now, it‚Äôs really easier said than done if you don‚Äôt grasp how rigorous the JC curriculum is and if your GPA and Olevel results were mediocre.

I can see you have the drive. But your A level plan that you gave yourself, like the others said, is not feasible. You can channel your drive into something achievable. You don't have to go to top unis to achieve your dream actually. If you can afford it or are able to take out a loan, you can take the SAT or something and get into a decent US school with the course of your choice. Otherwise your laselle/SIM plan sounds good too. Another option is getting a job and working your way upwards.\n\nDont get me wrong. There is a possibility you might be able to do well in the A levels. But it's extremely hard to get through the entire process even with resources + mock exams that schools give you. I'm speaking from experience bc I absolutely hated the process of honing myself to be good at exams. Plus there are a lot of intricacies to the exams that you will only learn with proper resources like tuitions or school teachers. Spending money on tuition for all your subjects for As is a waste of money I feel.\n\nBut on a positive note, I believe you will figure your way out. Everyone has these moments where they are confused about everything. And don't feel bad about being 'old' and having nth figured out.

[O Levels] Scoring Straight A1s for Secondary English and O Level English-- Paper 1 edition,:redditgold: MUST-READS: O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585837295.0,"In this discourse today, i would like to share my tips and tricks on scoring well in O Level english paper 1. I have seen many posts about students struggling with english, and ultimately not scoring as well as expected in N/O levels just because of a low english grade.

As everyone knows, english is a compulsory subject taken into account in all grading systems -- EMB3, L1R4, L1R5, EL1B2R2 etc. Because of this, i just wanted to say that Cambridge will make the english paper accessible for everyone. Accessible, by no means easy, nor difficult. The paper is structured  in a way which helps to maximise students' grades for the subject itself.

**Paper 1**

1. **General Preparation Tips**

Firstly, I would like to emphasise a point that many often overlook. How many points have you lost due to carelessness, especially because of poor grammar? PLEASE CHECK YOUR WORK. The english paper 1 is structured in a way that gives you sufficient time to reread your essays to correct these mistakes. Minimising these mistakes can actually help you see an increase in grades.

Secondly, reading plays a huge, if not the biggest, part of paper 1 prep. The common question would be: "" what kind of content should i be consuming?"" Let's be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don't think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question. Something that i find extremely helpful are the Beyond Horizons magazines. i'm not sure if these are ordered in all schools, but if you have the means to, the subscription is worth spending the money on. The magazine offers an array of content -- from day-to-day experiences and stories, to tips and tricks for writing, and even comprehension and editing exercises. They offer fantastic reads in each volume and can definitely help in writing. Reader's Digest is also excellent in the content they provide. The topics discussed definitely struck a chord with me, and in turn offered me inspiration to manifest my thoughts and opinions in my writing.  Apart from these two series, keeping up with current affairs is also paramount to aid with coming up with content and examples in writing.

Thirdly, vocabulary. Vomiting all the vocabulary that you know is useful ONLY IF you use the words aptly. Certain words have nuances that we often overlook, causing the word to be inappropriately used in a certain situation, resulting in deduction of points due to 'WW' -- 'Wrong Word'. I personally don't have the superb power to come out with an unbelievably touching story or discussion that will move the marker to tears. Hence i depended on vocabulary a lot. I was so desperate to use as much vocab as possible in my writing, that i compiled a huge list of vocab words and their meanings, and crammed my brain with as many as possible for me to use in my writing. Learning vocabulary depends on how much effort you are willing to put in OVER TIME . It cannot be done a week before the english exam. So, if you are preparing for O/N Levels 2020, PLEASE START NOW. 

2.  **Editing**

The easiest section of the entire english paper. It's basically a free 10 mark section. The tricks are simple -- identify the keywords that will help you determine the faulty parts of the sentence. Setters always like to hide the mistakes at the end of a line, or the beginning of a line. Read well. The mistakes are not as difficult to spot once you have a grip of what's going on in the passage. That being said, do NOT rush into circling the mistakes immediately. Go through the passage once first, identify if it is in past, present or future tense, then proceed with attempting the questions. Nothing much to be said about editing, just be very careful as to not make careless mistakes. 

3. **Situational Writing**

Be very clear about the formats. Commit the differences in formal vs informal, email vs letter, news article, speech, to memory. You do not want to lose any marks because of wrong format. Next, annotate the question given. Take note of your Purpose, Audience and Context. These are all defining factors on how you should sculpt your writing. Make sure that you are clear of the question requirements. Break the requirements down, assigning them a paragraph each. After writing, make sure that your piece has met all the requirements (task fulfilment). One thing that many struggle with is keeping the tone. While writing, you have to consciously remind yourself to take note of the tone of your writing. If you are writing to a senior teacher, for instance, be very aware of the level of his/her seniority and sculpt your piece carefully. One more thing -- DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER. Only give yourself 45 minutes, capped at 50. You need much more time to plan your essay, so do not dwell on situational writing for too long. 

4. **Essay writing**

My favourite part of english. To begin, if you have ever been told to just focus on the style you're good at, please throw that advice out of the window right away. Cambridge is unpredictable. You could be fantastic at writing expository essays, but all it takes is one difficult and abstract topic to come out and you could be screwed over right away. Hence it is important to be versatile in your writing skills. While it is important to hone your skills in expository essays as they are more likely to be applicable in the future, it is equally important to be well-versed in the skills of writing descriptive, personal reflection and recount essays. The first step to attempting an essay of sorts is to come out with a detailed plan. Underline keywords, identify the important bits of the question, find out how you should elaborate on each content paragraph. Planning is an important step that many often overlook as they find it unnecessary. Having a plan will give you a clear idea of which direction to steer your story in. 

I will further break essay writing down into 2 parts, namely expository writing and narrative essays. 

For expository writing, start off by making the marker want to read your story. Make it intriguing. Draw the reader in and capture their attention from the very start. Personally, i am more well versed in descriptive writing, but i enjoy writing expository essays more. Hence, I often start off my expository essays with an anecdote. An anecdote is a short story, or an episode. By drawing in a personal example of your own, or creating a short but intriguing story, you will be able to effectively interest the reader right from the start. You can also start off with a hook, a quote, or a popular saying -- there are a multitude of story starters you could use. In your planning step for expository essays, you must prepare your points for your content paragraphs. This way, you can expound on each point once you reach that paragraph, facilitating a smoother thought process and flow in your writing. In a discursive essay, you should ideally have about 3-4 content paragraphs, while in an argumentative piece, you can have 2-3 points which are 'for' the statement, and one content paragraph for a rebuttal. I will not delve into how to write each paragraph. However, what i would like to touch on is the usage of examples in expository essays. Whatever you do, DO NOT USE THEORETICAL EXAMPLES. An example of a theoretical example is ""If a man uphold his rights and beliefs..."" Do not do this. Always have fresh and upcoming examples at the tips of your fingers. This is where the importance of reading comes in handy. You do not need to memorise statistics, but you need to provide a clear explanation which showcases your understanding of the example you have raised. At the very end of your essay, remember to balance out your points and give a conclusion that does not specifically point to one view, but instead sums up the points in the essay and give an equal weightage to each of the points raised in the content paragraphs. 

Most of the time, students avoid narrative essays. Personally, I would also choose to write an expository essay over a narrative essay. However, narrative essays reduce the likelihood of writing off-topic, which can cost you many marks. There is much less to unpack in a narrative essay question, as they usually ask you to ""write about a time..."", which involves some personal experiences to be brought in. It is easier to hit the content marks for narrative essays, so long as you meet the question requirements. However, in order to write a good narrative essay, lots of description has to be brought in. Think 5W1H. Producing a good narrative essay piece that 1) isn't too boring and 2) doesn't sound like a primary schooler's essay can be challenging. This is also where a good command of vocabulary comes in handy. To be able to visualise the scenario you are writing about is also paramount in ensuring that the reader gets the clearest idea that you are trying to bring across. When writing an essay on personal recount or personal reflection, remembering to bring across your feelings will help express the story better, making it less dry and unappetising. Keywords in narrative essay questions are also extremely important. Students must be aware if the question is asking for one instance, or for multiple episodes. Many students often miss this out, resulting in undesired content marks. Remember to conclude the story well and do not leave it hanging.

I think the biggest hurdle in English is comprehension because theres no clear way to do well other than practice, practice, practice and knowing format of questions. I agree practice is important, but it seems like bs that that's all u can do"", '\U0001f97a\U0001f97aTHANK YOU', 'HAHA I\'ve been considering writing one of these in my spare time but it seems you got to it before me! I have to say that it\'s very nicely written and am sure it will prove to be of good help to many in the near future. With that said, I\'d like to expand more on narrative essays since that was my focus during O\'s.\n\nDisclaimer: I\'ve noticed that Singaporean students tend to favour the expository/argumentative essays over narrative essays, so perhaps this is me pandering to a niche audience? I do, however, think that writing a good narrative essay can be picked up. The ability to manipulate and utilise the liberties of language will serve one well even into the future, especially during GP if the student so chooses to follow the JC route.\n\n# The Narrative Essay:\n\nBefore beginning to write a response to narrative essay types (henceforth referred to as \'NE\'), one must first *read the question*. It is a no-brainer, but many tend to overlook certain words or question requirements (e.g. A funny thing your *friend* did, A time you were *disappointed after being heavily expectant* for an event, A *person* you *admire*...).\n\nMany NE questions are conditional and the student must fulfil the first condition before proceeding to answer the question.\n\n**Content-wise:**\n\n*Smokability:* 7/10. Most NEs will give a vague description of an event or person and let you fill in the rest. I find it helpful to envision the skeleton of the event/person in my mind, then build on to that, starting with the question\'s requirements.\n\nExample: A person I admire.\n\nHere the question asks for a person (i.e. cannot be an object or group of people) that I admire (i.e. look up to, respect, aim to be like etc.). I would first think of people I admire, and see if there are any that I can just write about. If not, I would then think about good traits and smush them into one fake person. I would start with ""core"" traits -- characteristics I find essential to being ""admirable"". These core traits could then develop into further characteristics of an admirable character.\n\nDo be aware that ""admirable"" does not simply equate to ""good"", and over the course of the NE, you will have to show that these traits, in certain situations, made the person admirable.\n\n*Something to note: As people are invariably flawed, make sure that your smoked character (if you smoked it) has their own set of flaws, although you do not need to expressly state them. However, a character overcoming their flaws or outgrowing them (character growth!) could also be seen as admirable, so make of that what you will.*\n\nInevitably, you will be describing the person\'s appearance, and so it would be beneficial to have some vocabulary to describe them. You do not, however, need a laundry list of words to do so.\n\nSome areas to describe: The hair and state of it (insight into the way the person grooms him/herself), the way the person carries him/herself, the clothes he/she dresses in, and interesting things about them that might stand out.\n\nExample: *She was a willowy figure, slight of frame, though long in limb. Her eyes were the same muddy brown as her hair, which fell in smooth curtains down her head and flowed around her shoulders. She was not much to look at -- her face was plain; her clothes were simple and drab, and she seemed to curl into herself when she stood, shoulders bent inwards under the weight of the world. And yet, the ferocity of her gaze! What a marvel to behold; all at once, the waif of a girl was transfigured into a queen, all by the intensity of her stare. It was at odds with the smallness; the slightness of her demeanour and body, but it was all part of what made her,* her\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vocabulary/Description-wise:**\n\nI suppose the advice would be to ""show"" and not ""tell"", but I\'m not too fond of that myself. I believe that sometimes brevity is of the essence, and a ""tell"" can have more impact than a ""show"" in some cases. Short, snappy, and succinct, it will draw the reader\'s attention quickly, instead of drawing it *out*. Many scenes can benefit from a good ""tell"", and if you are running low on word count, find a way to make some descriptions less ""showy"".\n\nMany students mistakenly believe that long, extensive descriptions will net them marks in the NE. This is true to an extent, but without good content, and appropriate use of the big vocabulary, there is no benefit to be had. For example, throwing in 10 big words in a single paragraph has no gain if they are not used properly.\n\nFor the sake of being pedantic: Do not ""photosynthesise"" big words incorrectly.\n\ntl;dr: you do NOT need to over-describe. It is a *narrative* essay, not a *descriptive* one. The primary purpose is to *narrate*, i.e. ***tell a story***.\n\nI suppose 5W1H would help you, the student, to develop your writing to some degree, but this is more for planning than actually writing. You do not need to actively 5W1H your plan either -- as you think and plan, you will invariably end up doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Structure-wise:**\n\nA NE has a beginning, and end, and a body. There is no real ""structure"" in a NE, though many write it as though there is one.\n\nMy advice is to begin not by directly quoting the question ""...Here is a person I really admire..."" but to answer it *through* the essay. Easier said than done, I know. Here\'s an example I might do.\n\n1. Describe the person\n2. Something he/she did that I found admirable\n3. How my impression of them was affected/changed and I began to find them admirable (or any other variant)\n\nThere is no real limit or minimum number of paragraphs a student should have. As long as the story is told, and the examiner is not reading a wall of text, then you are generally good to go.\n\nParagraphing is IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Break up your writing!! You don\'t need to fit an entire event into one paragraph. It\'s ok to break them up. Save them eyes pls.', '>Let\'s be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don\'t think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question.\n\nIf I may contend with this:\n\nWhile ""storybooks"" and works of fiction may not necessarily present one with ""real-life"" current affairs content (in the context of an expository essay), I don\'t believe that one should dismiss them so easily. \n\nMany (older) works of fiction have writing styles and a certain use of the English language that may read ""smoother"" or be more ""pleasant"". They also utilise vocabulary rather naturally -- it does not feel forced, and the ability to do so can be learnt. It is by reading widely that we accumulate various writing styles and methods, so while fiction may not have immediate benefits in the realms of general knowledge, picking up on the style/language used would invariably contribute to a better language mark.\n\nThe paper is, after all, 50% language and 50% content. \n\nAs another note, reading widely (and hence including fiction) would provide content for questions about reading, books, philosophy... etc. They may not be ""current affairs"" material, but consider a question that involves discussing culture, traditions, and history. An older piece of fiction could be used as evidence to detail historical practises (with the explanation that works of fiction are often representative of the society at that time). Books on war, like Morpurgo\'s *Warhorse, Friend or Foe, Shadow,* and *The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips* may offer insight into the consequences of war -- on soldiers, on civilians, on society as a whole. And et cetera. You know how the argument goes.\n\nGranted, not everybody has the time to invest into fiction, so I understand when you say you did not read fiction in upper sec. I recall reading books I\'d already read before instead of branching out into new ones. Perhaps they are not the same situation, but I do see where you\'re coming from.\n\nStill, though, I think it\'s kinda unfair to say that they are ""out of the question"". I think there are benefits to be had, either directly or indirectly. \n\nBut again, I see your point. Just my two cents.', 'what assessments should i do?', 'Wished someone had told me this few years ago..\nThanks for the tips, some of them are applicable to General Paper too!', 'Wow this is great!!

[Uni][Poly]Messed up my life...need some advice,University :snoo_smile:,1585834740.0,"Sorry for the long text below.

Hi everyone, need some advice on how I should proceed with my current stage in life. 

I graduated poly in 2017 with a poly diploma with a cGPA of 3. Went on to serve NS (medical unit) for 2 years and ORD'd last year. 

I didn't really use my time in NS well to think about what I should do after I ORD and just wasted those 2 years away. Tried applying for SIT Comp Sci near my ORD date because of the demand for IT jobs and I thought that I would be interested in IT. But of course, with no prior educational or work experience in IT, I was rejected. Told myself that I would wait for the next SIT intake next year to try again and took up some part-time jobs in between.

Tried for this year's SIT Comp Sci and also applied for SIM Comp Sci. SIT didn't get back to me so I enrolled into SIM. After starting at SIM, I realise that I might not really be interested in IT and just sort of convinced myself because of the demand...right now I just feel like dropping out.

Currently, I'm thinking of doing something in healthcare or allied health (due to what I went through in NS) such as nursing but that would mean going back to poly for a diploma for another 3 years and I'm not sure if it's the right decision. Another option would be to find a full time job but I feel like no one will hire me because I don't have a lot of relevant work experience for the diploma. Really need some advice on what I should do.

I can't really eat and sleep properly nowadays because of this issue...I just wished I had not made so many poor decisions in life and messed it all up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftmhiv/unipolymessed_up_my_lifeneed_some_advice/,7,"['Looks like you really haven‚Äôt found your interest. Why suddenly the jump to nursing? Will be you certain that nursing is your interest? Do you know what nursing really is? \n\nPlease take time to think this over. No use regretting what had happen. And there‚Äôs no shame in retaking a diploma, but please dont take those part time diploma or earn and learn if you wanna go to UNI. Those are not recognized.', 'have you looked into earn&learn programme or specialist diplomas at the five polys? not sure if they have nursing though', 'If you choose to go back to poly, do note that tuition grant will not be available as you completed a diploma course previously.', ""Since you already graduated from Poly with a diploma, going back to Poly to get another diploma is going to be really expensive because you won't qualify for tuition grant. Tuition fees without tuition grant per semester is going to be around $10k if I remember correctly. Also, without tuition grant, you won't be able to apply for financial assistance such as tuition fee loan. So unless you're loaded, going back to poly is probably not a good option.\n\nAn option you can consider is Parkway Health nursing! It's a private diploma and all their student nurses are sponsored by hospitals meaning you get an allowance every month with tuition fees paid and you'll be bonded to a hospital. Maybe the downside is that you won't be able to get into a local university."", ""You're still young and still have a whole life ahead of you. The decisions you made before has already happened, but it is what you do now that will define who you are. \n\nI think that it is important to first find out what you like and what you want to do first before you apply for any course. Take time to think through the reasons why you want to become an allied health professional and then take action. Volunteer at a hospice or seek a shadowing opportunity to find out if you truly want it. \n\nHowever, with the COVID-19 situation, it will be difficult to volunteer and interact with people so what I suggest is that you try to explore the courses available in different universities and list down a few you are interested in. Then, read the course module and take crash course on youtube to see if you like what you are studying. If you don't like what you are studying, it's better not to take that course or consider that path. However, if you are willing to put in the effort despite not liking what you study, then maybe it could still be suitable for you. Also, listen to talks by professionals on youtube to see what the job is like and what are the challenges in the job as well."", ""If you're thinking of health care you could try signing on in scdf as a paramedic.

   1. with rising AI, what effects will Singapore face in the next 10 years?
   2. With reference to Politics and Economics, how should countries reduce the impacts of COVID-19?

One parent said buy ASAP because what if stock runs out?

Another said I should wait because what if a new better model comes out later in the year.

If I buy it now ...

Pros:
- Working at home sometimes and can use the laptop for meetings (current desktop don't have mic and webcam, encountering some difficulties)

- can use the laptop before school starts to install stuff and have fun customising it
- don't have the worry about no stock if that actually happens

Cons:
- shorter time of warranty because it doesn't start in August(I'd imagine using it more heavily in Aug) so maybe when it spoils (OH GOD PLEASE NO) I cry
- maybe get salty & jealous when new model comes out 
- won't really use it since I have a phone and a TV to project my phone onto, damn big screen why need laptop lol

[Poly] cgpa 3.1 what to do after getting rejected by unis?,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585813310.0,"Hey there! Hope you are all doing well in this whole ongoing situation but am here to seek advice as to what I should be doing after my diploma. I‚Äôve applied for local unis however my gpa is only 3.1. portfolio is really outstanding. No regrets on my poly education cause I‚Äôve done my best despite my own circumstances. 

Recently friends around me have been getting interview invites and seeing that happening to them is hard-warming, but I actually broke down right after cause it hit me that I highly likely won‚Äôt be getting a spot in Uni. 

I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs has things planned out early and this time round it seems like for once I don‚Äôt? Wanted to apply for overseas Uni to do speech and language therapy/ occupational therapy but after going through an overseas internship stint I realised that I get homesick way too easily & wasn‚Äôt a feasible option. 

Current plan is to wait for rejection letters from unis to come in and then I‚Äôll start applying for jobs in the healthcare ( Community care ) or ncss sector and after that I‚Äôll have 2 options of undergrad studies 

1. Nus adult learner programme to do their FASS degree and major in social work 

Pros: 

nus cert would be more reputable as I may want to pursue masters in ntu‚Äôs gerontology 

Cons: 
only accept applicants with 4 years of working experience pertaining to say that I‚Äôll be 25 when I‚Äôm studying then & only getting a degree when I‚Äôm 28/29.

Have to drop work when I‚Äôm studying this cause it‚Äôs a full time programme 

2. Suss part time social work programme 

Pros: 
Part time programme hence I‚Äôll be able to juggle both work and studies 

Cons:
Degree Might not be recognised by ntu for my masters. 

have sources claiming that suss social work grads don‚Äôt get jobs easily 

I‚Äôm particularly interested in the healthcare sector ( nursing ) but there‚Äôs no private degree for me to do cause it‚Äôs all TOP-ups so I‚Äôll have to start from diploma if I want to pursue nursing but I‚Äôm not keen on doing that hence the shift towards social work. 

To seniors who completed poly and went on to work.. was it tough? And did you guys further studies in the end ?

[A Levels] Some common mistakes students make in General Paper Essays (Abridged),Junior Colleges :karma:,1585803099.0,"Hello! 

So, I'm attempting to pay it forward again for JC students. But before we begin, I'd like to emphasise - please, please, please stay safe. Stay at home as much as possible on your e-learning day. Sanitise your hands regularly!

Anyway, this is an abridged version of my blog post on GP essays . These are some of the common mistakes that should be mitigated as much as possible. The thing about GP - as someone who went through this gauntlet - is that these mistakes, no matter how small they may be, can easily add up. Without further ado, let's get into it!

**#1 - Not defining the key terms and setting parameters in a question** 

This is important as doing so will give you a roadmap for your essay, and potentially open up different interpretations. It may also cause you to think in binary terms. (See below)

**#2 - Vague arguments that do not answer the question**

This means writing stuff like ""Yes, indeed, the government is responsible,"" in response to a question like, ""To what extent is the government responsible for individual welfare""? It's not enough to simply give a stand, you need to be more specific w.r.t. *why the government is responsible*.

**#3 - Balance = Thinking in binary terms**

To many students, balance means an argument and a *direct* counter-argument. This isn't balance - *it's contradiction*. To me, balance means being accurate. In short, we can argue for something, say... ""practice is a very effective way to study"" *while pointing out its limitations*. This is still balance.

**#4 - Narrating examples instead of establishing the link** 

This means giving too much detail on the example, instead of explaining how it proves your point. It prevents you from being concise and staying laser-focused. 

**#5 - Disregarding grammar**

This mistake is something that undermines your language score, sure. But the bigger problem is that it prevents a clear expression of your arguments. It's really simple - if the examiners don't understand what you're saying, they can't give credit where it's due. 

So, yeah. These are, to be honest, elementary mistakes - i.e., you shouldn't be making them. But I'm pretty sure we all space out sometimes and lose our awareness of these things. (Trust me... It happens so many times. Even for me, as an adult.) This post is meant to help you stay aware of these mistakes!

Hopefully this helps. If you have any other questions, do PM me, or you can simply head on over to my blog for the 5 common mistakes on GP [essays](https://www.gpspectrum.com/post/5-common-mistakes-in-general-paper-essays)! (Much more details there, including quick solutions to these mistakes.)

Maybe some background:

* What do my parents think?

Luckily, I have a very supportive family and they are fine with all my choices as long as I'm happy. Even so, I still hope I can further my studies with minimal cost so that I will not burden my family too much.

* Do you have a good portfolio?

I have a relatively good portfolio in Poly? I was the Vice-President of my school club which is event-based. I also volunteer in my temple almost every week. And maybe that's it. I think these won't be enough to get into any local uni here.

Are there other options for me regarding further studies, should I change my path? If no options at all, should I consider overseas studies or should I continue working for a few more years? Feel free to be savage (maybe not too much), I really need some advise and directions.

[O Levels] Please don't undermine private tutors in this time of need,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585795098.0,"I'm a private tutor. I run a small tuition centre. After deducting rent, marketing & administrative costs - I take home around $2500 a month. I teach more than 10 classes weekly.

It has been a very demoralising few weeks.

1. Amidst the suspension of centre-based tuition classes - parents have asked for discount on fees. I tried to help whenever I can by waiving off fees or giving discounts, knowing fully that it will be at my own expense.

Yet, I've received a lot of comments from parents who do not have financial difficulties, going ""e-learning should be cheaper"".

e-Learning IS not cheaper than classroom based learning. It has been 2 sleepless weeks with this mad scramble to move classes online. We've had to to spend sessions doing orientation for you and your children to help explain how to do classes online. We had to buy IT equipment, video recording equipment - all of it not cheap with my measly $2500 monthly salary.

You think it's less effort - it's not. It's more effort and more work. And you want to pay us less.

Please don't undermine our efforts by requesting to pay us less. If you have financial difficulties, we will discount for you. But don't say ""e-Learning should be paid less"". Thanks.

Rental still goes on - landlords who don't take the initiative to help and pass on rental rebates, I'm looking at YOU!

2. We totally understand that why we have been closed down. Health comes first - sure.

However, can don't call us non-essential?

School is essential, tuition is non-essential. Minister said that. True facts of life.

But, but. Can you also see this.

In every sector, there are good people and there are bad people.

In the tuition sector, there are some of us good ones and some of us bad ones.

I dare say, I care about each and every-one of my students. I do my best to motivate. I do my best to talk to them when they have family troubles. I come up with extra worksheets when I know they are lagging behind.

In schools, you also have teachers who are not motivated, who only come to school for the paycheck and do the minimum.

If all school teachers are good - need tuition teachers for what?

If everybody scoring A1, A2 and A\* - then no need for tuition. Some parents find tuition because their kids have been failing.

We don't need you to recognise us. But don't call us non-essential can?

3. Common comment from school teachers and from the public - ""They should pay school teachers more"" or ""Tuition teachers make so much money"".

You know how many times I roll my eyes at this?

Straits Times - I'm looking at you. Thanks for always reporting on ""million dollar"" tutors. Now everybody thinks that all tutors make millions.

Reality check - If you are a school teacher and you think you will make a lot of money leaving the public sector, feel free to go try your luck.

Is every school teacher a Principal? or a Cluster Superintendent? or a Director? No right?

Same thing with the private sector ok? The top tutors make a lot of money. The normal tutors like us make close to the 'median' $4600 of the typical Singaporean.

We don't have CPF.

We don't have AWS.

We don't have performance bonus.

In November & December, we eat bread but still pay rent.

Whatever we earn in 10 months, must ration across 12 months, because November & December parents go holiday and don't want tuition.

No - regular tutors don't make millions.

Stop dreaming. Most school teachers are not zai. If they leave the public sector, they will eat grass.

I make $2500 a month - if you feel that is fantastic, you can be my guest. You have a choice. If you think you can make more as a private tutor, take the plunge into the world of the unknown.

4. Teachers got a lot of admin work, not like private tutor only need to teach

We don't have admin work. We have ""admin work"" - marketing, accounting & trying to keep the business alive. We don't only teach.

You have a 'clear thick' line between yourself and parents. We don't. We are obligated to answer, and talk to parents everyday. Do you know there are parents who call us and talk to us everyday about their kids and their anxieties? (a lot of parents from top schools are actually very anxious about their kids) I spend 1 to 2 hours daily talking to 2 to 3 parents everyday.

5. Thank you for classifying us together with KTVs, Bars & Entertainment

I called the bank to lower my credit card interest because in anticipation of school closures, I invested heavily in video recording equipment and IT equipment that I actually cannot pay for with my measly salary.

Guess what the bank said? You are not from an eligible 'adversely affected' sector.

Adversely affected = tourism, aviation, F&B and entertainment.

Entertainment qualifies but private education doesn't qualify.

Again, i understand why we have been shut down. But can everyone remember us private tutors have families to feed too? Mortgages or rent to pay? Bills to pay?

6. We are human beings too

We have feelings. We have empathy. We have tried to help whenever we can. My tuition centre offers free tuition all these years to whomever are on MOE Financial Assistance scheme. When parents face difficulties (retrenched, fell sick), we always cut our fees or give free. When students ask for extra help, we coach and we don't charge extra.

We are trying our best too. Really. We are all in this together.

I don't know since when being a 'private tutor' is a nasty thing.

Maybe tuition centres like Learning Lab, Mavis Tutorial or any of those big tuition centres with big MRT and bus adverts and sprawling land space of more than 10000 square feet might make millions of dollars a year. Maybe they have strong investors with hundreds of millions. But hey that's not us. Don't assume that we have a mountain of profits to stomach this because we don't.

Also, a lot of our kids and a lot of our parents always tell us that school teachers always say bad things about private tutors. ""Tuition is a waste of money"", ""don't need go for tuition"", ""private tutors are not qualified and don't know what they are teaching"".

Some teachers seem to spend a lot of time bad-mouthing private tutors.

Grass always seem to be greener on the other side.

You get your bonuses, your CONNECT plan, your PB and your 13th month. When the economy does well - you get extra money for doing absolutely nothing extra.

2 to 3 year 'old' Teachers pay around $5k to $6k. HOD teachers pay is ""7k to 10k"". VPs more. Ps on Superscale can make $200+ k per year. Stop making comparisons and keep saying private tutors make more.

Just focus on teaching your kids please. You still have a job.

I may not have one when the dust settles.

Also, remember that a lot of us private tutors were once school teachers.

Some of us left because of school mergers.

Some of us left because we were pregnant, had kids and could no longer cope.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with this thing called EPMS.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with all the politics, committees, organising overseas trips and want to just focus on the kids.

In fact, they saved the transportation time for themselves and their children, they make it sound as if they‚Äôre being disadvantaged. \n\nI‚Äôve thought of opening a centre too but the overheads deter me, especially with the last two months of the year when we have little income. Some parents approach us for lessons but once it‚Äôs holidays they want nothing to do with us, cause they want to save that month or two. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äòso you expect me to still be around when January comes by if all parents are like you?‚Äô Such is life. \n\nEvery job has its pros and cons so I accept it because I rather teach (it‚Äôs my passion) than work in an office job. No bonus no cpf but oh well I have freedom.', ""I get that each child's pace of learning is different, and that you want to do your best to tailor what you teach to every individual student, but trying to do give that 110% to every student you face will only lead to you burning out.\n\nI feel one benefit to e-Learning material is that it can be reused, assuming that they were crafted to be modular from the beginning. While the expenses have piled up in the beginning, you could possibly reuse some of the material in the next academic year, barring drastic changes to the syllabus."", ""I empathise with your points, speaking as a private tutor myself. Yes, e-learning isn't cheaper. Yes, we're all severely impacted by this. And I understand your frustrations. \n\nAnd personally speaking, (& as a GP and History tutor for A Levels, I'm super upfront about this with my students) I believe there's an issue with MOE that's preventing effective education. (If not why would we have jobs? Lol) I've also received some personal anecdotes about tutors that simply turn up with assessment books, and get their students to practice on the spot while they play mobile games. (I mean... come on, really?!)\n\nNevertheless, this is something EVERYONE is going through together, regardless of who they are. I have friends in the gig economy or in the private sector (regularly paid jobs) who have been temporarily laid off. So, we should really engage in constructive dialogue rather than ranting. We can also find ways to adapt, like tightening our belts, or even finding a 2nd job. We work hard to add value to the education landscape - and I firmly believe this pays off in the end, not just for ourselves, but for the younger generation.\n\nStay strong, man. Happy to talk more about this with fellow tutors in these hard times."", 'True. Am a student myself and my Econs tutor was complaining about how they only had 1 day to react to the shutting down of centres. Everything was rushed and am suprised the lesson turned out smoothly. Really appreciated it. \n\nParents should understand the needs of private tutors at this point of time, and not just exploit the situation in their favour.  But this is easier said than done since most of them do really have a choice to switch tutors/stop tuition eg. and this would put the private tutors at a disadvantage (because of the competitiveness of tuition services in Singapore) to explain to them. \n\nSome school teachers don‚Äôt really bother about students having tuition teachers as to them, its the results that matters in the end. Though this is true, I have had several encounters of secondary sch teachers and jc teachers who speak badly of tuition teachers, saying that they are ‚Äúnot updated with the syllabus‚Äù, does not know the ‚Äúformat that Cambridge expects‚Äù eg. I mean, its the student‚Äôs choice whether to have tuition or not since we are the ones in charge of our own education. It‚Äôs also wrong to critic the tuition industry since they are also trying to make a living.', ""As a private student tutor myself, I empathise with the additional hours of work and effort you have to put in to gather all these resources to move tuition online. But at the end of the day, no job/business is safe and secure due to the unpredictabilities one may face in future, just like the current COVID19 crisis. When business earn a lot of money, they also don't give back these extra profits to their consumers who contributed to their profits right? There are risks undertaken into running a business, and we cannot always assume it to be a 100% success. \n\nNo doubt it is true that additional expenditure and time is spent on IT/Tech appliances and resources to ensure Elearning goes as smoothly as possible for every student you have, as a tutor myself, I highly doubt that online tuition as opposed to face-to-face tuition is more effective, and thus you see some parents scrambling here and there demanding cheaper tuition fees etc etc. For instance, online tuition doesnt allow for the catering of students with different learning speeds( not impossible but a rather tedious, arduous process), but tuition face to face works. I believe as a full time tutor youself, you know that for sure too. Justifying the additional costs spent on IT stuff is merely a reason to account for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced, but should not be exacerbated as a veto factor for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced. If online tuition could replace physical tuition/teaching, there wouldn't be a point in having schools right? Moreover with the roll out of HBL/SLS assignments in schools, there is less of an incentive for parents to have their child go for online tuition if teachers in schools right now are doing it also (also helped out in a sch to set up resources for a certain subject too last week, and probably over the course of next few weeks).\n\nJust my two cents worth. No doubt your current circumstance may be an agonising one, but the difference in quality/delivery of a tuition lesson one may receive online as opposed to one whereby the teacher is physically present to me has significant nuances."", 'This should go onto mothership...', 'Can summarize?', 'There‚Äôs no one size fits all solution unfortunately....\n\nThank you for your sacrifices and genuinely not being condescending, I think you can look for financial assistance. \n\nhttps://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/covid-19-financial-assistance-retrenchment/', 'Ok non essential worker', 'As a private tutor, I agree with you fully!

1) NUS has its NOC programme which gives either a 6 month or 1 year overseas experience to students. I heard though its competitive they open up a lot of slots for students. NTU also has similar 6 months or 1 year overseas internship programmes like the OEP as well as other choices providing shorter trips. But I rly want to score the longer 6 month of 1 year programme. Can someone tell me in which uni, is it easier to score those kinda prog? I am aware I need to meet requirements and probably pass interviews in both unis but I would just like to have a guage of the availability of those kinda opportunities in each uni. 

2) And are they equally as enriching? Bc I read some stuff where students who came back from NUS NOC created some start up successfully. I'm sure people who went on NTU overseas prog also did some amazing work but anyone care to share any that uve heard?

With an increase in cases, the hospitals would be unable to take care of these patients as well as before. More people are going to die.

&#x200B;

To restrict all gatherings to less than 10 people and yet still have people go to work/ school is the most hypocritical thing I have heard. We have to be ahead of the virus, not behind it. Keeping offices and schools open when there are other options such as home-based learning is wrong.

&#x200B;

Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease. Children can spread the disease, and also DIE from it. I am sure no parent wants their child to be the first child to die. If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we? They have schools open for only children whom cannot stay at home.

Anything? What about the single mother with two children working multiple part time jobs? How is she to help her children have any sense of normalcy if a sudden shutdown were to be imposed? What about the family in a single room HDB that can‚Äôt afford a computer? If everything shuts down how are they to continue studies and keep pace with everyone else? I think many are speaking from a position of privilege and fail to see that this is a very real existential issue for thousands of singaporean households.

Do they go back to take care of their children and compromise our primary defence against the virus?\n\n>If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nThe UK, as did most of the West, has completely bungled its response to the coronavirus, and was forced to take draconian measures to stop the tidal wave they introduced. Both the US and UK have also had to cancel national exams, throwing millions of students into a state of uncertainty for their future and ambitions. I think it‚Äôd be fairer to compare public health measures with Taiwan and Japan, for instance. \n\n> The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. \n\nI agree that in the long term, public health and the state of the economy aren‚Äôt diametrically opposed. However, it is unfair to compare this to SARS. Look at the US. Relatively unscathed by SARS. For the coronavirus, unemployment claims now stand at more than 3 million, the highest it has been in American history (here‚Äôs a graph as reference: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-3-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week-almost-5-times-the-record-high/) Think about trade-dependent Singapore in that context.

No rational company will be seeking to employ with these economic conditions. This is projected to be the worst recession in Singapore‚Äôs history. The government has offered unemployment benefits, which it has almost never substantially done in its decades of rule. As the US, Malaysia, China falter, a second wave of economic crisis for us. This is a far more severe economic problem. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs a game of costs and benefits, and the fact of the matter is that the situation is more nuanced than most would likely hope it to be. No perfection to be found on earth. I took a look at your post history and you‚Äôve asked a similar question 2 weeks ago, and commenters there have given very valid points you should have considered"", 'I will just explain why the economy being bad is DIRE. \n\nassuming schools are close, our economy worsens.  this will result in retrenchment. \nand hence, those working in retail,  your taxi uncle or even your waiter will have no job. \n\nwhat will happen to their family? \nthey will have limited savings,  and they have to compete with others to buy for necessities to cope with covid. prices of stuff like toilet paper and staple food HAS risen. and it will continue to rise if economy worsens.  and Singaporeans will panic buy and with their limited savings, they can only buy a few. and i think they will die faster before covid hits them. #hardtruths\n\nwhat will happen to all of us? some of us may not even be retrenched.\n\nbecause we have an increased in the number of needies (you mention theres other way to help them without schools right),govt has to pull more money to help them. they have to spend on 1) delivering the items to them 2)finding out who they are (who got retrenched recently, who is below the poverty line...) 3) spending money to help them get over this tough time\n\nand since money doesnt fall from the sky, this means LESSER funds to go into healthcare. Lesser masks, lesser funds to buy more covid-19 swab, lesser funds to operate the hospital and many more.. \nwhat will that mean?  MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.  MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE CURED.  THIS WILL GET OUR OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE LOGISTICS.  OH NO', 'Many ministers and country leaders have said that Covid-19 may drag on longer than expected, even until next year, so do you suggest that we close schools and offices till next year as well? Many schools taking IB are already affected with the cancellation(?) of their exams which could affect their university applications. Are we just going to pause everything we‚Äôre doing till 2020 is over and pretend that nothing has happened?\n\nIMO, with how open Singapore is, there‚Äôs always going to be new cases like how we‚Äôll have to face many waves of cases (eg. China, UK/US), so there‚Äôs not really a way to stop the number to 0 unless you want to stop visitors from coming in and cause our already-slowing tourism industry will continue to dry out.\n\n‚ÄúThe economy will not collapse‚Äù How are you so sure? I actually believe that this is only the start (of Covid-19 and also of the effects on our economy) and many times, the effects will actually continue to spill over even when the outbreak is controlled. If you didn‚Äôt know, Singapore‚Äôs economy already started slowing down in 2019 and there were hints of a possible recession in end-2019 even without Covid-19. Latest release by MAS showed current projection is about -1 to -4% in GDP, drop from the initial projection of -0.5 to -1%, that‚Äôs about 4x. If the schools and offices were to close, the contraction will be even larger and companies may end up forcing their employees to take unpaid leaves if Covid-19 continues.\n\nWhile there may be all the different packages pushed out by the Govt to support all the employers and employees, money doesn‚Äôt drop from the sky. You can‚Äôt expect to keep pulling out money without putting money in, can you? There is a limit to the amount we have in our reserves and we shouldn‚Äôt take them for granted.\n\nMaybe what you can do now is to practice good hygiene and good money habits.', "">If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nplease look at the UK.  is the UK doing anything better than us? \n\n>The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine.\n\nhow naive of you to think that the SARS is comparable to COVID? the SARS is afraid of the heat,  COVID is not.  COVID would not.  SARS lasted for five months and this is already the fifth month of COVID and it isnt getting any better\n\nThe ECONOMY will collapse. Yes we are fine now from the consequences of SARS,  but repercussions are terrible if we completely ignore them after it.  If we have not reach that stage yet,  let's not close them down.  Some repercussions include 1) drop in material and non-material SOL 2) inflation (look at it,  everything is increasing in price ) 3) retrenchment and many more\n\n>Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease\n\nthink about it. \nyou may be old and capable enough to buy food for urself. but what about a handicap boy? or what about a primary one child that has to walk 10minutes to buy food? if ur a parent,, would you be worried? do u think the chance of getting injured at home because these little kids are unable to handle themselves are any lower? \n\nnot only that, many students depend on the school for food. if schools are closed,  do you think they will be able to live? \n\nhow can you ensure that millenials like you are staying at home and not outside partying? think about it,  would you not leave your house AT ALL? Can you say the same for the rest of the peers? \n\nand the people that are at higher risk are often older people and not students so please don't be so worried.  a lot of people are actually infectdd at home and not at school. have you seen a school cluster yet? \n\nI think the schools are doing a very good job now. Staggering recesses and everything. \n\n>They have schools open for only children whom cannot stay at home.\n\nso double job for the teachers??\n\n\nand if you cannot finish your syllabus (assuming ur a sec 4kid),  so do you want to take olevels next year?  waste one year?"", 'I am taking ib exams this year, honestly i am worried about not finishing coursework too, but honestly if I get sick, I wont be even able to take the exams.', ""Do you think millenials are stupid? Singapore has already closed almost all entertainment areas, where will they party? at other people's houses? Their parents will definately curb them from doing so. Using this as the main argument against closing schools is just...\n\nOh my god, 'older people at higher risk...' but that doesn't mean school children are going to get it. I do not want to be the one that carries it back to my family.\n\nDo you actually think the schools are doing well? have you been to one lately? trust me as a student, the staggering and seperation isnt working. in fact due to this many students are unable to buy their food on time to eat it, and the canteens are still holding the same number of people.\n\nyou dont need the whole staff to keep a school open. 2-3 teachers a day on rotation will be enough.  with reduced numbers the chances of getting COVID-19 will be greatly reduced.\n\nAnd honestly do you think singapore is the only country where kids depend on the school for food?"", 'ah yes then just go to school and study. \nif everyone is afraid of getting sick and carrying out their basic responsibility (your basic responsibility as a STUDENT is to study) then who is going to work and keep Singapore going? are the doctors,  who are saving so many lives now,  not afraid of getting the virus?  Are our government,  the one who are trying to implement so many policies and reassure us  not afraid of getting the virus? Are our janitors,  the one who are cleaning and exposing themselves to viruses, not afraid ?\n\nEveryone is afraid but everyone should carry out their basic responsibility', "">Do you think millenials are stupid?\n\nI'm one.  And I think so.  Please look at how many of them went to club on the last day.  And how indifferent were they to the entire situation. \n\n>Singapore has already closed almost all entertainment areas, where will they party? at other people's houses?\n\nis partying the only place you can think of?  they can go to shopping malls or loiter someone else.  \n\n>Their parents will definately curb them from doing so.\nplease tell me how many of them actually listen to their parents.  maybe ur parent is strict or maybe ur a good kid but u cant expect everyone to have parents like urs\n\n>2-3 teachers a day on rotation will be enough.\n\nperhaps that's what u think.  who is going to clean your classroom?? who is going to teach?\n\n>And honestly do you think singapore is the only country where kids depend on the school for food?\n\nSo your point is? just because we aren't the only one means that we have to ignore them?\n\nwe are really doing so much better than other countries and are being praised by so many others.  hopefully, you would have less rant and be more appreciative."", 'all moe schools have tons of laptops, the teachers are teaching the rest of the class on sls or like google meet, and these kids in school will also do the same.
