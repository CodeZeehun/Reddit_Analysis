I rly wan to choose the right one to put as my preference cuz the essays need to be specific to the preferred RC and if that RC rejects me, the likelihood of other RCs accepting me will be pretty low...?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fxs8vu/uni_nus_rc_application/,1,"['look at the modules they offer and see which RC has modules that interests u more!', ""Hi, from Tembusu here. I'm personally not very sure about how they evaluate the interviews, but honestly I think it should be fine as long as you be yourself and show your passion to learn. I still remember during my interview, one of the other students was using 'The Matrix' as a comparison to the issue of internet privacy, and I still asked him to explain about the movie because I didn't watch it. I'm not saying you should do that during the interview, but just have fun and share your own unique perspective on the issue! (Hint hint: Diversity!)  \n\n\nRegarding the focus, we do have activities pertaining to environmentalism, but I don't think that 'critical thinking and writing' is really their main focus? Maybe it's because I'm not too sure about the other colleges, but I feel that no matter what module you take, critical thinking (and writing, though I think it's more about how easy it is to understand your text rather than making it beautiful) will always be involved.   \n\n\nThen again, I'm not really the best rep of Tembusu, but I hope this gives you an idea! I think another factor you might want to consider are the IGs of each college. For me, there was an IG that wasn't offered anywhere else, which played a big factor in my choice of RC.

[JC] dropping h2 econs to h1,Junior Colleges :karma:,1586428191.0,Any seniors who dropped from h2 econs to h1 econs even though ur essays are better than ur csq? Did ur grades improve? Pls share ur experience w me as I have to make a choice by next wk... T_T,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fxq3nq/jc_dropping_h2_econs_to_h1/,3,"['Hi, I didn‚Äôt take H1 but in my opinion if your essay is good I feel that the reason why your grades may be suffering is not actually because you can‚Äôt cope with the content (because otherwise you would do badly in essay as well) but rather because your CSQ is pulling you down maybe because you don‚Äôt know how to make use of source material to answer the questions? If that is the case dropping to H1 where the only mode of assessment is CSQ may actually hurt you. Basically just try to pinpoint what exactly you are struggling with. If it‚Äôs the amount of content, then maybe you should drop to H1. If it‚Äôs because your CSQ answering technique is weak, I suggest you don‚Äôt do that. All the best!', 'I wouldn‚Äôt advise dropping from H2 econs to H1 as I feel the only difference to in doing that would simply be fewer essays to answer. Honestly, the standard of H1 and H2 is the same. Econs skills are transferrable between CSQ and Essays (and CSQ have mini essays too so whats the dif) Only difference is that CSQ uses source evidence while Essay uses real life examples (have to memorise). \n\nBesides, Essays are really easy to score if you plan well. Its level based marking and hence I would emphasize on this few criterias of a good essay. (1) Scope: Range of perspectives (2) Depth: Content development (Did you use economic analysis with diagrams and evaluation) (3) EXAMPLES: this is the main dif between L3 and L2. ie 9 marks vs 7 marks. (Assuming your content is accurate and you answer the qn) \n\nEssays can also be developed from reading model answers and identifying how they elaborate their content. \n\nCSQ on the other hand, may be harder if you cannot apply the content to the context given. Hence, CSQ rly got to practice. Always aim to use Knowledge-Evidence to answer. Lift evidence from extract and explain it in terms of econs jargon. \n\nI studied this way and improved from 46% (E) (J1 MYE) to 68% (B)(Promos) to 86% (J2 block test). But of course, 4 H2s are rly heavy and if you rly cant cope, you shld drop it! Feel free to dm me if u got qns.', 'Same situation as you last year, essays better than csq scared cant cope with h2 and all that. But you have to realise once you drop your entire grade is determined by CSQ so if you are not too good at that then gg. I suggest you dont drop and keep practicing CSQ by online paper or consultations. Once you get comfortable with CSQ, you will naturally start to see your grades go up as well. \n\nJust my opinion', 'Hello! I dropped H2 econs to H1 econs last year when I was J2. \n\nReasons why I did so was because:\n* Significantly lesser content for H1 as compared to H2 (only 2 elasticity concepts instead of 4, no market structure, no globalisation & trade for macro)\n* Easier to cope, had more time to focus on other subjects (for me, GP)\n* I hated writing so much for essays HAHA hand dieded after every practice/exam\n\nReasons that made me hesitate dropping:\n* My essays were scoring slightly better than my CSQs, and I found CSQs quite hard in J1\n\nWhile CSQs may seem daunting, its important to note that you will get alot more practice doing it in J2 if you do choose to drop!! I don‚Äôt regret dropping to H1 at all because I really hated market structure :‚Äù) \n\nBut... on the flip side I do know a friend who made the choice to not drop H2 Econs and benefited from it as her other H2 subject scored a lower grade and hence her Econs grade helped to pull up her RP\n\nWhether you choose to drop or not is one thing, but more importantly, make sure to follow through with effort regardless of whether you‚Äôre taking H1 or H2 Econs! :) All the best for JC!', 'a U in h2 econs has the same rp as a U in h1 econs so dont drop /s', ""Didn't drop but if your essays are better than case study then I would advise against dropping since H1 is all case study and they have one more 10 mark question for each case study so is 80 total for a single paper while H2 is just 60 for paper 1. If you are losing out on the 2-6 mark ones then I would say either you are wasting time on them and/or don't know how to write the short ways of explaining a process and/or basic understanding of a concept. If it's the 8-12 mark ones then it's also either time management, don't know how to pick out points in the case study to write about etc.\n\nConsult your teacher about it because he/she would know what you have been writing.\n\n(And I know someone who dropped and he said that H1 was harder for him because of the lack of essays but that's for him so think about yourself and what you have written.)"", ""Thanks!!

If your topic statements are good and hit salient tensions of the question you should at least hit 15m-16m. Then from there, the difference between a 15m and a 20m essay is how rigorously you use textual evidence and interpretation to back up your topic statements.

There is time to complete but not ditch and rewrite.\n\nI feel that a good lit essay needs the feeling - like it's hard to quantify but sometimes it's just a spark in an essay that makes you feel something elusive. It's not something that you replicate by reading model answers (not that we really get many lol) but by knowing your text very very well, and being inspired by the question that is presented to you.\n\nOften, the first thought, no matter how fleeting, is worth talking about because that's how the question makes you feel, and it lets you engage with the question on a personal and sensitive level. \n\nI'm not sure of the current rubrics, but my teacher once used on which said that the highest band goes to students who provide insights the examiner had not thought of before, that had a high level of expression, personality to the answer and sensitivity to the text.\n\nThat said, my best tip to revising is not spamming practice essays, but to simply read more and more of the poems everywhere, to draw lines of similarities and pick out things that repeat.

[Junior Colleges] Is it just me?,Junior Colleges :karma:,1586419336.0,"Ik it has been almost 2 months of JC and now one month of HBL. I still feel rlly out of place. Sadly, i got into my fifth choice and the JC i joined i had no idea abt it until olvl results day. I have heard its an prestigious JC(not HCI or RI or ACSI). I find it so hard to adapt in this jc. I used to be a full on extrovert always voicing out my opinions and being generally loud from young. But once i entered this JC, my character has changed for the worse. For the first time in life, i have become an introvert and i am rlly scared ppl would judge me. I dont dare to voice out my opinions anymore.

In addition, i simply cant seem to make frens. When i was in my OG, i feel like i didnt click with people there but fortunately i had my sec sch fren with me in my OG and she faced the same prob. During OG i was with her so i didnt feel rlly lonely. I talked abt this to my frens and they all said in class you can click with ppl and find frens there. They asked me not to worry. But once i got to know my class, most of them knew each other either thru sec sch or OG while didnt know anyone. I tried hanging out with ppl but like i cant seem to click with them. If i am silent, they wont even know that i am there although i would be sitting in the same table as them. I feel rlly insignificant and lonely in jc. I used to love going to sch but now i completely hate going to this JC. Tbh i am happy there is HBl. Idk what to do anymore.

Ik many would say frens arent impt alvls is but like i just want someone go thru this same journey with me so like we can face the struggles tgt. In my Jc, ik i am not the only one, there are students from other classes in my jc going thru the same thing.

Hi everyone! I think the COVID-19 HBL crisis has brought out the best in many people and it's been really heartening to see so many initiatives popping up for students.

As a 2019 JC grad my kokoro goes brokoro thinking of the JC kids who will be losing a lot of academic support in this time (as if A Levels weren't hard enough!) Especially for us Arts/humanities students, having consults cancelled & teachers overloaded is absolutely devastating because getting our practice essays marked is the absolute bread and butter of improving in our subjects. (With CCAs cancelled, there's also so much time to write essays but little resources to mark them :c ) There's been a lot of help in free 1-1 tutoring and AMAs, but still a gap for Arts students who don't need to learn content but need to practice argumentation.

I'm in no way a professional but (a) I do have more experience than your peers (b) probably also way more time than your megastressed teachers and your other stressed peers. 

**TLDR:** If you need a critical eye to review and feedback on your practice essays for H2 ELL and History, you can email them (and the questions/question paper) to [humansforhoomans@gmail.com](mailto:humansforhoomans@gmail.com) ^((haha because humans for people but also humans for humanities...))

* I'm only confident/qualified to give feedback for H2 History and ELL ^((topped Hist for Prelims, topped ELL both J1 and J2, A's at A-Levels for both)), but if anyone would want this for other Arts subjects comment below! I can try to cobble more friends to help. *If you are keen to help in any subject, drop me a DM!*
* No hidden costs!! You can send in as many essays as you complete (but please lah, send work you've put effort into, don't just spam). But if you find the essay reviews super helpful, consider paying-it-forward by donating to help COVID-19 relief efforts (eg, my suggestions, [buy a meal for now unpaid migrant workers](https://www.giving.sg/campaigns/covid_19_support_fund_for_our_foreign_workers), or [buy meals for  Singaporeans hard-hit by the economic slump+support local food providers](https://www.giving.sg/the-food-bank-singapore-ltd/covid-19_relief_feed_the_city_take-away_edition_) )

Ik that sounds kinda crazy but its actually doable. In fact i wrote 1 compo a day for a few weeks before o levels and slowly my marks crept up from 16/30 to 26/30 average. It rly improved my grammar and vocab and even spelling lol. \n\nFor compre i reccomend u analyse the o level paper from past years. Like see the answering technique and how to quote etc... Like a example wud be visual text qn whr they show u the picture then ask why they put the picture. The technique wud be smth along the lines of analysing the picture and describing it and explaining how it links to the qn. eg. the picture depicts ________ which suggests that ________. And the same for section b the 1st qn whr ur supposed to quote and emphasize on ur ans. Eg. ""Quote the quote"" emphasizes how/that____(change word given in the qn abt the description with a synonymous word.

Just up to 3 pens and a few paper, and abit of creativity"", 'Vectors: also, one common problem among students that they dont realise is to *RUSH INTO THE QUESTION* before visualizing it. This is a topic you have to slow yourself down in the exam to understand what the question is talking abt, and what they want.', 'I take it you\'re J2 this year? \nThere are 2 options you can choose:\n\n1. Screw the learning, just want the grades. \nYou need to practicing with the answer key. Look at the question, look at the answer key and copy all the steps one by one, then repeat until you see some pattern that you can latch on. Dont expect a A/B with this strategy, because novel questions will throw you off. Also, because this is mainstream strategy, you will likely get average grades. But average is decent, and to some, decent is good enough. Where to get questions with step by step answers? Your school lecture notes and TYS. \n\nNote: you HAVE to find the pattern to solve the questions you copy, otherwise, you are no better than a photocopy machine. You will get the same grades as a photocopy machine.\n\nAlso note: if you get real good at pattern recognition, with abit of luck, you might still get an A/B, in spite of a lack of deep understanding. \n\n2. Actually learn\nYou need to understand WHY you are learning these topics, rather than what or how to apply. This is a lifehack method to learning. Have you ever had an experienced with a loved one that taught you a lesson you will never forget? Yet for dry subjects like math, the formulas and concepts slide off your brian like water off a duck\'s back. That\'s because they lack meaning - the ""why."" You will understand that without it, it is an uphill battle to understanding, even memorizing is difficult. On the other hand, if it were meaningful, you wouldn\'t even need to think twice in the exam to recall the formulas and concepts. Your mind works like clockwork, and you can even wrestle with novel questions to come up with a good answer. Getting an A/B is much easier with this strategy, but it requires a different mindset. You cannot be seduced into blind ""mugging"" like other students do. You know that focusing on conceptual understanding is an investment that pays good exam performance in dividends. \n\nUnfortunately, you can\'t just read your school notes to get this. Notes are intended to pack information in a concise fashion, not be a novel. It is the teacher\'s job to bring out the ""why"" of the topic in a meaningful way. But you can\'t choose your school teachers, so ask your friends who have a deeper understanding of the topic. Alternatively, you can find tuition to help. But be selective of your sources, they need to teach you what you are looking for, not rote learning (recall option 1), which many advocate. Otherwise, you could do that on your own. You need to pursue understanding, and be selective of your sources. \n\nIf you do this, the path will be smoother for you, and you\'re likely to do well not just for JC, but for your future endeavors. Again, not easy, you need the right mindset and help. I did this and got A for H2 maths years ago. My students also make drastic jumps in their grades. \n\n\n\nThere you have it. Two simple strategies. \nIf you have read this far and took the time to internalize the ideas, you will have gained a good profit. \n\nP.s. I like your question, because it was honest. Motivated me to give this full sharing. Keep them coming', ""Hi! I'm J3 and took H1 Math as well; may I know exactly which part in pure math you're unsure about?"", 'Vectors: I\'ve given some advice on vectors in another comment here, please look it up. Ask if you have any further questions\n\nPnC: I\'ve also given advice on PnC\n\nProbability: Usually tests venn diagram or tree diagram (occasionally table of outcomes). You also need to know independent vs mutually exclusive formula, and conditional probability will almost surely come up ""P(A|B)""', ""1. P&C is arguably one of the toughest topics in JC math. Ironically, it is not the heaviest weightage. My advice is to clear the bigger chapters first (calculus + rest of stats). Only when you've reasonably mastered those, and cleared your other subjects, then you can hone in on this topic. Your are juggling many balls. Prioritise. \n\n2. Plan the day based on what you want to do, rather than the work you need to complete. Then fit the neccessary work in. (Eg. Read a novel.

But to those who‚Äôve got their emails and was unfortunately rejected, I‚Äôm so sorry but I‚Äôm glad you took the risk to apply for it anyways, I know it‚Äôs heart-wrenching and I always say feel what you need to feel but make sure you get yourself back up in time for the next chapter of life. I wish you joy &amp; the best of luck in your lifelong learning journey!

It\'s still an opportunity where it\'s ok to screw up.  \n\nIf your main concern is being in the leadership role, I would say just go for it since it\'s a good learning experience where nothing can go wrong.  \n\nIf your main concern is adding stuff to your portfolio, then it makes even less sense to step down.

Not to say I agree with them but this is the way it is.

You are right, UCs do care more about grades, so keep that in mind when you apply to them, my friends that got offers from Berkeley/LA all had stellar academic results (I‚Äôm talking 85 RP and above for prelims kinda stellar). \n\nSo to answer your question, yes, poor results will hurt you. Take note that hwachong sends your predicted grades (from your prelims) to the schools and if your internal results are poor, your predicted grades will likely be on the Low side too. This will hurt your application since you‚Äôre only sending in predicted grades as your only indicator for your As performance. UK schools might not offer you if you have bad grades. Same for US schools. In fact, US school do not look at your actual A level results (unless you‚Äôre a guy and you apply in NS). Their rationale is that your general performance should reflect your academic ability. However, even if your grades don‚Äôt look so good, as long as they compare well to your peers (I‚Äôd say top 30% in cohort at least don‚Äôt quote me on that), you should be set. Put yourself within the A percentiles in your prelims so that that your predicted grades will be all As. That should give you a good chance at most universities you apply too. Your As performance is important, but only so you can fulfil your offers for UK universities and only to show US universities that your grades have not slipped significantly. You are offered before your a level results are even sent so your internal examination results need to be good in comparison to your peers.  \n\nI also need to clear the misconception that a good SAT score is enough to tide you through bad grades. In fact, I personally don‚Äôt even think SAT scores are that important. I know a friend with 1400s that got into swarthmore (a very selective liberal arts college). US universities know that our academic curriculum is rigorous and would rather see you performing well in such a difficult curriculum. So yes, SAT score is important to get you considered but as Long as you fall within the 25th - 75th percentile of whatever school you‚Äôre looking for, that‚Äôs good enough. My SAT score was not amazing for hwachong standards, but I fared well in the end.\n\nThat said, even if you think you grades aren‚Äôt as good for some schools that you apply for, I‚Äôd suggest apply anyway, as Long as you have some schools on your list that are a good match to your grades. The key thing about US admissions is that it is so arbitrary and random, because there are too many factors to consider in the admissions process. Do you fit the profile of applicants they need this year? If you play a certain instrument or do X extracurricular, how many students do they need that play this instrument or does X extracurricular? Please note this: good grades doesn‚Äôt guarantee you a spot at any university (even the supposed easier ones with 30% acceptance rate), you need to fit the specific applicant profile of the applicant they want.\n\nDiversify your US university list, expand it to include universities you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have considered. I know a lot of amazing friends that applied all ivy leagues and got all rejects. You need to apply to a mix of target, reach and safety schools because as internationals, the process can be even more random for us. Take me for example, I got into an Ivy League but was waitlisted at NYU (note: NYU is not a safety school lol), the application decisions just do not make sense in the way you think they do. It is also important to know what major and course you wanna study in, because every US university has its niche and is good at different courses.\n\nOf course, your grades aren‚Äôt the only factor if you wanna go US. Do well in your extracurriculars, Most importantly, write well and keep writing. This is the one factor that will set you apart from most Singaporean students and may soften the blow of not-so-good grades in your application. Draft your common app essay early and have your friends read through it. Go through multiple revisions, review your supplements. Sell yourself as an applicant that can contribute meaningfully and is a good fit for the school. Friends (and myself included) who got into their dream schools put in an insane amount of effort into our applications. It‚Äôs not like UK where good grades and an okay personal statement will get you into most schools. If you want to go to a US school, you gotta research into the process and try to game it as much as possible. You got this!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions :)', 'HC don‚Äôt use GPA though but just rank points/ABCs since that‚Äôs the end goal (A‚Äôs) but you don‚Äôt really have to worry that much...The overseas universities usually will know that internal school examinations (especially like HC with quite a reputation) will be more difficult than the actual A‚Äôs so they wouldn‚Äôt be expecting you to get straight As for those exams.\n\nMy advice is to just try to do as well as you can and stay within the top XX% as far as possible so that your predicted grades will be high. I didn‚Äôt apply for US but they consider applicants in a more holistic way as well so you may want to consider how else to stand out other than your grades.', ""Which overseas unis are you looking at? Which country? What majors?\n\nUS unis won't care too much about your GPA too much if you have a strong SAT score and good application essays. Depends on how competitive the school and your desired program is. Like Ivy League and some of the more competitive public schools like Berkeley may be a different ball game.\n\nUK will look at your grades in subjects related to the program you apply for. So like if you're applying for English they will look at your Lit grade but not your math grade. Like before, Oxbridge might be a bit different."", ""Just do well for your prelims straight B at least (?) and get predicted straight As or close to it anyways. I didn't make it for prelims and my midyear and block tests were S&U trash. \n\nEven though I did well for J1 End of Year exam and A levels, it didn't help my application and I failed going to top US unis. \n\nBtw grades r more important than CCA/extra stuff/essays. Without CCA/any extra stuff u can still make it to top Liberal Art Colleges in US with financial aid (my friend did). But without grades like me, u can go nowhere LOL. \n\nBut then again I'm not from Hwachong which consistently feed students to top overseas colleges so I don't know.""]","[1586316229.0, 1586314466.0, 1586314225.0, 1586323397.0]","[10, 3, 2, 1]"

Went on to take H2 Math and finally got a B for it in my A's , and i'd say i'm pretty satisfied as i never got along with math ) so AM is not compulsory per say, but it does give you an advantage over the rest even though i don't think its much."", 'Thank u!', 'thank u!']","[1586309924.0, 1586312887.0, 1586317686.0, 1586321815.0, 1586344582.0, 1586442714.0, 1586313530.0, 1586313525.0]","[4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

A bit of background about me, I took A level in 2019 and my PCME/GP PW grade is AAAA/B A. I also took triple science n double humans (elec geog and pure literature-- joy luck club n julius caesar) with HMT Malay. I got mostly A1s with A2s on Malay and Chemistry & B3s on English n HMT Malay. 

Anyways, I can help you with questions and provide consultations for free (Zoom video call/telegram) and also provide some tips on uni admissions (UK & US -- I failed some of my admissions cuz my J2 grades were bad, S & Us bad, but I think I have a good grasp on what they want to see in the application). I can also tell u more about some scholarships/local u subject interviews (the ones I'm doing right now anyways--still don't know the result though) and some tips that help me improve my S&U grade for Chemistry. 

I have no tips on how to improve for O level, but I can help answer subject questions.

DM me if anyone is interested ok. If u want to zoom/telegram, just dm me ur email address (for zoom) + time to meet or telegram username. I'll contact u back.

"[A levels] Being mediocre is worse than failing rn, I need advice",A Levels :snoo:,1586241152.0,"I am a J2, taking PCME. For the majority of J1 and now my MCTs, I've been getting average marks for my exams except econs (S) lmao. Initially, I was satisfied with getting 50s as I knew JC was tough. But over time, I just got worse and worse. Despite this, every time exam season kicks in, I put in a lot of effort and just about manage to scrape another 45-50 for each subject. 

So some of you may ask, what's the issue? I should be ok or even happy with my passes right? Well, being mediocre means you are neglected by the teachers who think you have done OK. This means not being down for remedials and teachers not checking my work etc. I have taken advantage of this, and not done a lot of my tutorials, which I think will eventually lead to my downfall. 

This is why I say being mediocre is worse than failing right now, because I end up becoming satisfied over my average marks and proceed to slack. Of course now that I have identified the problem, I want to address it. But the problem is I do not know any way of studying consistently and I feel quite scared to consult my teachers because I'm scared of getting whacked for asking those type of basic qns (esp by my strict math teacher).

This method of comparison is often true. When I had to collect the cert separately for those 80+, the people i saw were mostly (when i say mostly like 95% shockingly) were already the ones who get principal honor roll. And my friends who constantly get average actually end up getting RP which is hovering around the school mean RP. Thus u can predict technically your actual A level score range.

"[a levels] need advice from people who wanted to go into art stream, but were forced into science stream",A Levels :snoo:,1586236434.0,"

okay so ill summarise my situation right now.

i want to go for a lit based course in uni and was aiming for a scholarship as well, and hence aimed for an arts stream, bc i knew i could do rly well, and get a good rank point. i mean, youll be more likely to get a scholarship with a better rank point right?

but i was forced by my parents to go into the sci stream, and the only way i could take h2math and h2chem as they wanted was if i went into mi, so here i am, in mi, taking h2 math and h2 chem.... both subjs that im like only okay at. need to put in alot of effort esp bc i didnt take amath or pure sci, and my math isnt that good in general.

(im taking a h2 lit which is the only thing im rly happy w learning and stuff haha)

anyways

im stuck here... in mi for 3 years.... to learn sciences i really dont want to... and bc of this my rank point is most probably gna be lower than what it might be in an arts stream... 

so i just want to know: 

1) does my possibly lower rank point situation affect my chances of getting a scholarship in a lit based course?

2) people who are/were stuck in sci stream when you wanted art stream, any advice or words of encouragement to get me through these three years? anything is helpful!

thank you and i hope everyone is safe n healthy ‚ô°‚òÜ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fwelmx/a_levels_need_advice_from_people_who_wanted_to_go/,8,"['hi!! i was from mi (graduated last year), from arts.\n\n1. yes! scholarships are really dependent on your rank points. even if you have a stellar portfolio, it still depends on merit no matter the course. you‚Äôll need to try for at least 87.5+ rp to stand a chance, tbh.\n\n2. i know someone who was forced into science and did alright, but mi‚Äôs arts and commerce streams usually produce much better results than science (i‚Äôm not sure why? i do know my teachers were absolutely amazing though). you can do, just gotta work really hard :) please don‚Äôt slack off in y1!', 'Hi how are the education in MI? I am retaking my maths and science tis year for o levels and i am planning to come to MI next year. Are the subjects hard in Mi esp maths cos my maths is not very strong but i am gonna do my ultimate best this year.', 'Ya definitely. Scholarships look at Overall RP (Not by subjects) + other internal/external achievements.\n\nTo encourage you, Sci subjects are usually easy to do well with consistent practise and clearing of doubts. What motivates me for sci subjects (I take hybrid Math Physics Geog and Econs) is that it is easier to check your answers since theres always a definite answer and you do get credited for method. Also, Sci subjects dont require you to memorise as much stuff as Art subjects do, which frees up a lot of your ‚Äúmemory space‚Äù. Generally my sci subjects are A, while the art subjects hover between C and B. (And I study art subjects for longer periods of time) So ya, art subjects rly hard to score in school exams (for me). You shld be relieved haha! At least you got Lit :)', 'I‚Äôm answering this question assuming that by ‚Äúarts‚Äù, you‚Äôre referring to humanities instead of the performing arts / visual arts bc i‚Äôm a clueless fool when it comes to them \n\n1. It definitely affects. scholarship providers often say that judge you holistically, but that doesn‚Äôt undermine the importance of rank points, since it‚Äôs one of the fastest ways to filter people. (UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUPER OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO & tbh since you‚Äôre  doubting yourself, i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs bc you don‚Äôt have one) and i can tell you this is probably one of my biggest regret, bc although i did well for humanities at a levels, my sciences (which made up a huge chunk of my subj combi) screwed up my rp. so if you really want a lit-based scholarship , you should try your best in sciences too (but ofc focus should be on lit since it‚Äôll be pointless if u get straight As but B for lit HAHAHA)\n\n\n2. I was in the same situation as you just two years ago. I was more passionate about humanities than sciences and my O level grades made it clear that Im more suited for the humanities (straight A1s for humanities & languages and straight A2s for all my maths and sciences). Still chose sci stream in JC and oh boi, got straight Bs for maths & sciences but straight As for humanities and languages. So I truly understand how bad it can be when you‚Äôre forced into science stream. However, I wish that someone told me back when I was in JC that arts & sciences complement each other & just because you enjoy/excel in one doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the one is irrelevant to you. Just right before my A levels, I realised that I shouldn‚Äôt be all grumpy & unforgiving about being forced into the science stream, bc a science education can make my humanities essays sound more well-informed & in general, make me a more logical person (instead of a rambling fool who bases arguments on pure emotions). so, don‚Äôt get too upset when you get shit grades for sciences / when you have to mug for it, because all these sufferings are for a greater purpose - to value-add to your pursuit in the humanities/arts.', ""I considered joining the arts stream since i took double humans double science in sec school. But settled for science stream in the end because i thought that i would definitely be unable to do well enough to get into uni if i went there.

Nursing never really had a good image amongst the middle-aged to older generation and there's some social stigma surrounding Nursing though thankfully (I hope) some of it is starting to be dispelled. I'm actually more of an Arts and Humanities kind of student so it was either FASS or Nursing for me. I have interest in Biology and wanted to take Pure Biology after Secondary 2 streaming but my school forced me to take Physics instead LOL\n\nI brought up the following points to my parents to reason with them and aid them in understanding why I eventually chose Nursing as my first choice over FASS:\n\n In terms of practicality and employability, a career path in Nursing is not only more stable but it pays decently as well. Furthermore, after reading through the modules I realise there's a moral ethics and social science aspect side to the field of study that I had previously overlooked and I do really like. In addition, a career in Nursing doesn't always require us to be on the front lines during pandemics or times of crises (I believe that is the part where it is the most concerning to our parents, since they tend to worry about our safety) and not everyone works at the quarantine facility, you could return to the research field of Nursing or become an educator in Nursing. Also, the Nursing degree itself opens doors to other career options where the relevant skills are valued. Without doubt it's one of the most meaningful jobs out there \n\n Yes hopefully we will see each other in Nursing next year. Do let us know how things go for you. Congratulations on your stellar A level results btw!! I did really bad for H2 Math HAHAHAH That was where I screwed up :')"", 'Hope to see you around too ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'I took by myself since I only need a soft copy.

I think we share quite a bit of similarities. My first choice is actually FASS & tbh even though I prefer nursing, a part of me upset that I will no longer be able to study my beloved humanities as much as I did in JC. \n\nIn secondary school, I had to take Physics instead of Biology because I wanted to take pure history and my school only offers it with physics. So technically, I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to take physics (but tbf I did enjoy physics lessons, my physics teachers were kinda quirky & adorable).\n\nUnfortunately, my parents belongs to the bunch of older generation who has yet to update their views. No matter how much I try to explain the different career pathways for one holding a nursing degree, their conclusion is always ‚ÄúAiya whatever lah, just don‚Äôt put it as your first choice if not <insert boomer‚Äôs view of a nurse‚Äôs job scope>.‚Äù\n\nTbh, initially I thought I would be okay if I got accepted by FASS.

For my main course, i cannot speak much on revisions and exams bc i never had a single exam paper to take for my diploma. But i did take a Diploma+ in Psychology, and for that, printing my slides were a big help. I like to have physical notes I can refer to. For my revisions, reading back, then writing a chunk on what i can remember helps. (eg. ""Experiments, date of experiments, a short summary, any other details) Then I make a list of things i forgot to write about.

My internship was really enjoyable too but i also got lucky with a great company and work environment. FYP sucked ass tho, client work is never easy, but it was a great score bc I ended up doing graphics for Legacy Fest, the one that replaced ZoukOut last year.\n\nOverall a fruitful journey.', 'Oh! For me I didnt have a CCA but still left with many friends from different courses. Firstly you have Gen Ed/SIP, common core modules that every student has to take. And from there, the students in each class come from different courses, so you can meet friends there! For me, I was in Visual Effects and my other Gen Ed half was from Engineering. \n\nYou can also do events! Like helping out with SP Open House, you see people come and go alot. Or if youre selected by your course for showcasing/overseas competition etc etc, thats another way. Personally, I had 2 overseas trips (UK & Taiwan) with students Events Planning Management.\n\nAnd you still have your secondary school friends! Or even Pri sch!

I personally did noy have a CCA, so i had a lot of time and energy to work, club, party and mug.\n\nFor CCAs, pros are: Good way to expand social circle, A really good chance to score great points on your resume/portfolio with performances/competitions/overseas trips etc etc. The camaraderie you get from CCAs are super satisfying, and you get a big variety to choose from! And having something to look forward to really saves your mental health in times of need. Extra group of friends to meet and have fun with! Being limited to your own course can sometimes be stagnant and boring, a change of crowd is always refreshing.\n\nCons are: legit no time to do work, and sometimes you might hate the CCA but get pressured to stay. Or you can be so into the CCA that you forgo your diploma work. And for some CCAs, you need extra equipment, which means more cost. The commitment to exco, camps, events etc is high too, if you're in those. And if you need to go overseas to rep SP, youll have to miss classes and sometimes, precious revision/project work time.\n\nWho should and shouldn't join? Well.. there's really no formula for that HAHHA im so sorry i cant answer that."", ""Hi! (sorry this will be damn long paiseh)  My workload in dvemg was manageable, but im someone who had no other commitments outside of class. That means no CCA or interest clubs. Year one was actually really enjoyable and the modules were honestly informative, engaging and really interesting. Keep in mind that all of my work was project-based. So for year 1, it was probably the easiest year. Workload was about 6 modules? all concurrently done at the same time. Different due dates but all fell in the same week. sounds like alot but bc the work was simple enough, i could take on all 6 at once.\n\nYear 2 ripped me a new asshole tho LMAO like fuck,, the modules were intense. And my smartass decoded to take a Dip+. Scripting, Storyboarding, Visual Effects, Full productions, then Gen Ed, some 3D modules AND qe had an attachment with USS for the qhole of their HHN as makeup artists. so imagine your class starts at 8, you end at 4, rush off all the way to fking harbourfront, do makeup until 7pm. Thats every weekend for the whole of a month. Quite heavy and no time,, but tbh also on my end i was fucking partying twice a week so... HAHAH My gpa was 3.7 then. Good times! It was a lot of late nights in the studio, and all the deadlines would be intimidating if you didnt pace yourself well and put priority to the earlier due ones. But having your friends to slave away together really made everyrhing damn fun\n\nYear 3 ripped me another new one too, for FYP. internship was the best time of my dvemg life HAHHA, the work environment i was in was amazing, co-workers were great and i scored w a company that saw me as an asset, no a commodity. FYP THOOOO wow... client work is.. something. thats all i can say. my teammates and i died every damn week, deadlines were 4 days away from the next deadline. it was hell for 5 months.

Like in a week, probably 1-3 full days, if youre lucky, your timetable might even have a free day with no class HAHAH The rest of the week is probably like,, average 6-ish hours? And because it's project-based, your deadlines are the week before MSTs, so you get one extra week of holiday when everyone is in school taking exams."", 'Elective modules are not counted into your overall GPA.  \nI\'m not sure what you mean by ""tutorials""... if you\'re referring to homework-type \'assignments\', it depends from tutor to tutor but it\'s generally counted as part of GP (General Participation), which in total takes up around 10% of a module\'s grade.  \nHope this clears your doubts.', 'Hi! A few things really! Firstly, it\'s a new environment, with new people, so everyone has no idea how everyone else is, personality-wise. It\'s easier to do something you\'ve never done like try making more jokes in class, answering qns more, asking for help more bc then people wont be like ""hmm thats so unlike you"". Does that make sense? \n\nHave lunch with different groups of people! Dont just stick to one group from the first day. Its easier to get into multiple social groups and cliques, as it\'s everyone getting to know each other so they really just take anyone in. \n\nEven from the different classes! If you have mass lectures, sit beside someone from the other class so you can talk and share experience! Or smile at people passing by in corridors, especially those you recognise or pass by frequently. \n\nSay hi to Foodcourt aunties/uncles!! theyre very nice and they love students talking to them, not just ordering from them. Ask them if they ate, or what time they started that day. Comment about how hot it is or how it keeps raining. HAHHA \n\nI\'ve already been a pretty outgoing person even before poly, but yes, poly did enhance my social skills. I learnt to approach people better, and make friends from wildly different backgrounds. Very fun time. Just go ahead and say hi on the first day!

Modules that were challenging for me was Creative Storytelling and Compositing Fundamentals. For CST you had to storyboard, script, shoot, edit and produce a short 5 min video. Group work. I died there. Storyboarding does not need artistic skill, it can be stick figures too. The one that needs artistic skill is a module called Draw, it's in Year 1. \n\nFor ComF, the software was just an asshole. tough software to get a hang of but very satisfying when you do. and most likely its this lecturer, jeff. He's fking funny and a friend. He tries to do this thing where he scares the year 1s by being damn strict, and he is. He will rip you a new asshole if you play around w him. But afterwards in year 2 he's chill as fuck, the most imo, out of all the lecturers.\n\nAnd yes! Whole course goes to HHN together. its a great opportunity to mingle w the other class. It was really quite fun. And yes! Year 3 is where everything comes into play. Though i will suggest not to take client work LMAO, not just my clients but every client for every FYP group was difficult. When you have your own personal project for FYP, its easier to make changes, stay motivated and generally have an easier time. But then again hopefully your group mates are manageable too! \n\nHey if youre gonna be in DVEMG, good luck! it was a great fruitful journey for me. I strongly suggest putting in the most effort in year one, be the most extra for that one freshman year, because the modules are easy enough to score good. The key to make your thibgs look nice? emulate styles you see on behance, instagram etc. DO NOT COPY, but take colour palettes, artistic influence from them. Texture overlays are your best friend too. Learn photoshop, C4D (3D software) and After Effects well, these will be the ones you use the most.Dont forgo things like class participation marks too. Grab every mark you can, because if you score low on class participation/resume submission etc, you lose an easy boost on your grades. then after having the good first year, just maintain it, dont have to improve if you cant, but just maintain that good gpa. bc most people play first then work later, bit its too late. once you lose that first opportunity its tough to get it back up to a good gpa in the next to years as jumping up 0.20 a miracle. most people just jump 0.02 tbh. Consultations sound lame and useless but it really really helps. Get as much help from lecturers as you can, its a grade bump too. \n\nhey good luck! and if anything, months down the line you need help, just PM me"", ""yes, i am! omg yes i was kinda scared for CST cause in a way, i'm not all that creative (i just really like design and creating but not in a i have a lot of ideas way) but honestly, seeing that it's group project actually relieves me (since i can have more ideas from different people). ahh i think i got interviewed by him for eae (iirc)! ah okay, thanks for the tips regarding FYP! i guess i'll be clinging onto my laptop throughout the 3 years based on your advice AHAHAH. i'll definitely work hard especially since this course seems like a very rewarding one! thank you again, and thank you for inviting me to PM you in the future, i'll probably need it!""]","[1586236620.0, 1586236787.0, 1586230252.0, 1586229457.0, 1586237164.0, 1586239899.0, 1586262110.0, 1586279838.0, 1586343806.0, 1586381466.0, 1586397021.0, 1586415296.0, 1586237597.0, 1586237144.0, 1586280924.0, 1586230864.0, 1586230367.0, 1586237933.0, 1586259141.0, 1586264446.0, 1586336987.0, 1586398028.0, 1586397384.0, 1586241172.0, 1586336511.0, 1586232273.0, 1586232322.0, 1586262500.0, 1586267011.0, 1586397475.0, 1586263504.0, 1586268053.0, 1586268959.0]","[7, 7, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 6, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2]"

[A LEVELS] content overload for h2 hist,A Levels :snoo:,1586226566.0,hi i'm a j1 and i'm currently studying sea democracies and there're SO MANY case studies stuffed with so MUCH content. my tutors said that we would have to write at least 2 case studies per para for essay. can i have any more tips from yall seniors? thanks! ><,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fwcatt/a_levels_content_overload_for_h2_hist/,7,"[""I had the same problem last year. \n\nWhat I realised by promos was that there's no point trying to memorise all the case studies. Rather, you should try to organise the case studies into categories of a topic. \n\nE.g. Topic: military \ncategory: military in the government/military regime\ncase studies:\n\ncategory: military subservient to govt\ncase study: singapore\n\ncategory: politicised military but not in govt\ncase studies:\n\nThis way you can identify the case study that best shows a certain scenario and only memorise that one case study properly and use it whenever you have to write an argument on that topic.\n\nYou can also prepare stock arguments that are commonly written.\n\ne.g  military regime successful in terms of\n\n1. Point X + evidence\n\n2. Point Y + evidence\n\nmilitary failure in terms of \n\nPoint A + evidence\n\netc\n\nThis way you can pre-plan common arguments and use them to revise. Also reduces thinking time during tests. I had an issue of not being able to think of all the causal links fast enough during exam, but with this method I already know all the links beforehand and can just write them."", ""actuallyidk\\_ has a really good sorting tip, but also wanna remind you that for SEA essays you need to use 3 countries at least for each essay! So inside your essay you have to put in three countries worth. \n\nThis is important especially when questions include terms like 'post-independence' -> which immediately wipes out all of your Thailand evidence. \n\nIt's also worth noting that in different topics, different countries are of different relevance. A simple example is when you study the AFC. Naturally, Indonesia and Singapore are key because they represent the worst hit and the least badly hit. So, it's good to have a good grasp of these two to start. Then you pick other countries by point: So if you are looking at an AFC causes question, and you want to talk about the trigger event of currency speculation, you will look to Thailand and Malaysia -> two case studies for one point. But, that doesn't mean you need to study all of Thailand and Malaysia. Like actuallyidk\\_ has mentioned, a category you go for next is 'weak macroeconomic fundamentals', so you learn more from the Thailand side to combine with your in-depth knowledge of Indonesia. \n\nAnother good tip to have is of course to see the links in your topics - eg how nation-building and multiculturalism/assimilation affect economic prosperity and later stability - and how all of these are tested via crises like the AFC - after which the type of govt may impact the responses to the crises, and how the people react afterwards. Building the links really helps with the memorisation side."", 'Hi! You can DM us on Instagram @01step_at_a_time and there‚Äôll be someone to answer any of your questions!', 'exact same experience in j1 that made me want to give up on SEA honestly LMAO. what worked for me was write out essay outlines for different questions, and i found out that there were some case studies that can be applied throughout a variety of questions. i just memorized those specific case studies and made sure i knew all of them very very well. then i moved on to the ‚Äúlesser used‚Äù ones haha', ""Yes, this is actually quite useful to do. Another way to look at it is to 'study by question' in which you focus on what evidence and details you want to use for each case study in each argument. Of course its also important to note that you may end up not using a lot of the nitpicky details in your notes (because you prob won't remember them) but you must definitely remember the details that help you make a case/further your argument. \n\nOne way to make it easier to remember details is to rewrite the notes in your own style and you can make it more concise by categorizing it by argument/question. Rewriting is generally helpful for memorization, and writing it in your own phrasing might help you remember it more easily.

The opportunities and network you‚Äôll get is much more valuable and global compared to at a local university.\n\nMy cGPA from SP‚Äôs Biomedical Science is 3.429/4. It‚Äôs honestly below average. I screwed up in year 1 because of a break-up and I regret getting affected. In year 2 I knew that I wanted to do Medicine so I worked my ass off and consistently achieved 3.7 to 3.9. 3.429 won‚Äôt land you a spot in a local medical school for sure. The only overseas medical school I‚Äôm eligible for is the University of Adelaide. The school fees are AUD500,000 which my family does not mind paying for, but I feel like studying in Adelaide for 6 years won‚Äôt give me as much exposure as studying Biomedical Science in Yale-NUS/UK/AUS/USA followed by Medicine in Duke-NUS/AUS/USA.

[META] PSLE Math Rant,META :redditgold: ,1586186585.0,"I posted this like a month ago but it got removed but I checked and it was still on so I was like whaaat. Anyway...

No, I am not taking PSLE this year, but something far worse. My cousins do and they always ask me for help mostly in Math. This has probably been reiterated many times. But I just wanted to rant about something I feel needs to be addressed in the primary school education system. In this particular case, it's for PSLE Math. I don't know why but it's just too difficult to solve those damn questions, especially without the use of simultaneous equations. For me, that is the challenge, doing questions with those god damn models and explaining it clearly to my cousins. 

It's time-consuming for me to think about the questions, and I presume it's worse for them. I remember my upper primary days being stressful and thinking I was stupid for not being able to answer those questions. I remember my parents paying for tuition that tried to teach me simultaneous equations, but I didn't know how to apply. See, I feel like if simultaneous equations were taught earlier then those kids will be less stressed out and have more fun in school.

I've seen people in JC getting 210 for PSLE and even some Normal Acad students excelling in H2 Math and even taking F Math. All I'm trying to say is that PSLE is one of the worst exams ever and I hope the syllabus changes to be a bit more advanced because algebra makes everything super easy. And as seen in secondary school, all algebra takes is a lot of practice to master, and not having to UNDERSTAND confusingly-worded questions and solving using MODELS. 

My hope for this rant is that more people, especially 12-year-olds and their parents, don't see PSLE as life defining because that shit is TOO hard and if they work hard and smart in secondary school everything will work out.

But I guess that's how MOE identifies IP people."", ""LOL I also still can't do psle math whenever I see assessment books in popular"", ""It's a good thing that the use of things like simultaneous equations won't result in loss of marks. \n\n[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318214429/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2007/20070217.htm)."", 'Honestly I feel that the PSLE wasn\'t difficult, just tricky. From my own experience of taking PSLE and looking at other years\' PSLE Math paper, all the questions were able to be solved using the methods that the teachers taught from the syllabus, stuff taught from outside the syllabus only made our lives easier such as the simultaneous equation method. From what I saw in the ""killer questions"", those just required some out of the box thinking and looking things from another perspective sometimes. \n\nThe main reason that people seem to overlook is that PSLE is set by SEAB, while O and A levels are set by Cambridge in partnership with SEAB. The reason people find O and A levels simpler may be because Cambridge tests for understanding, while SEAB likes to test for the students\' ability to apply concepts. Take the circle question from last year for example. You can see that the question isn\'t difficult, it\'s just testing for the students\' ability to apply their understanding of units and parts, together with their ability to visualise that the two lines are equal. \n\nThere are always questions that are supposed to test your ability to apply, along with questions that test your understanding. This is how MOE differentiates (pun intended) the A students from the A\\* students. ""A"" students should understand concepts fully, while A\\* students should be able to understand the concepts AND apply them correctly. \n\nAlso, if you haven\'t noticed, these ""killer questions"" only make up a small percentage of marks in the paper, around 5-8 marks. Enough for people to go ""Aiyah! I didn\'t get A\\* cos of this question!"" which is ultimately the point of such questions, and it isn\'t the case where ""Aiyah! I fail cos of this question!"", because there are other, simpler questions that test for understanding which make up around 60-70% of the paper.', 'Math is not about solving the question and getting numbers. MOE is teaching math in a way that forces students to THINK, analyse the problem and draft up an appropriate path to the solution. I strongly believe this is an integral part of education and it should start young.\n\nWhat I really hate about is secondary schools and JCs teaching math mechanically. You see equations and numbers, you don‚Äôt see the meaning, you don‚Äôt see the relevance, you don‚Äôt see why the concept of introduced in the first place.\n\nThe PSLE math questions presents a problem, and uses model to help students analyse the problem (visual learning). This helps them understand the motivation of mathematicians having to invent simultaneous equations, which is more abstract and not every student and understand.\n\nMost primary and secondary school children can solve simultaneous equations easily because you are taught to move numbers around mechanically. That‚Äôs not the point of math. In secondary school you are introduced to calculus, you learn how to differentiate, but have you learnt why the concept of limit was vital? Have you learn how mathematicians moves from infinitesimal calculus to using limits as a foundation? Have you tried to understand why the reverse of differentiation between two point - definite integral - is the area under a graph? Have you learnt why dx behaves like a number when it‚Äôs mathematically invalid to say dx is a number? You don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt understand math the way it should be . MOE is trying to have primary school kids understand math, not move numbers around.\n\nAs an NUS High student, I can clearly see why MOE is designing the curriculum to be that way, because my curriculum require me to think deeper and my exposure to other curriculums in other countries made me understand how they approach math education (ie Hungary) \n\nHungary didn‚Äôt outperform Singapore in PISA, but Hungary‚Äôs math curriculum is said to be one of the most beautiful and elegant; and students understand and APPRECIATE math at a deeper level. Think, why? \n\nAs with sports, math require practice, practice, practice. I cannot stress this enough. Knowing how to read musics notes on Paganini‚Äôs piece doesn‚Äôt make you a violin master, practicing and being able to perform it well does.\n\nWhat‚Äôs disgusting is not the curriculum or the questions being tough, is the\n1) expectation that everyone should be able to solve every question and the \n2) mechanical understanding of math\n3) Parents getting upset because their kids can not solve some problem\n\nYou just have you understand that \n1) Exams are NOT designed to have everyone score a 100%, if you can‚Äôt solve it given all the resources, you have to accept that you have much more to learn \n2) Singaporeans learn math for grades, most understand how to solve but does not truly understand why math is the way it is. 3Blue1Brown is a good example of what _understanding math_ is like.\n3) PSLE is not a major milestone in life, not even close. It‚Äôs only a measure of your academic proficiency at 12 years of age, nothing more. Kiasu mindset is ruining the purpose of PSLE. \n\nPSLE teaches a child more than just the academic content, it also let them taste how real world competition is like. Accept that.', ""OP you literally said everything I wanted to say. And I'm still pretty appalled that model drawing is still a thing now, I thought it stayed in my boomer days.\n\nModel drawing and simultaneous equations not being allowed was what made me get C for PSLE math and eventually 209 in a cohort that's already very competitive. Yes I did get blasted for not getting at least 220+ or 230+, but I am not faring worse now just coz I was shit at primary school problem sums, and it definitely never affected my Emath grade."", 'Bro i cannot agree more', 'honestly i did quite well in most of the maths exam except that one p5 maths mye paper which i failed badly. So i was a bit complacent and didnt study much for psle maths. End up getting up a B cuz i found the paper quite hard... and i got 213 in psle. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH U. Whenever i look at psle maths, i really wanna use algebra and calculations that i have learnt in sec sch instead of the stupid models. I found sec sch maths(e and amaths) or even jc maths(so far) easier than psle maths. I wish they can implement more algebra concepts from sec sch in primary school then they have more time to grasp the concepts!', 'Some find it difficult, others find it easy. All part of the bell curve.', 'PSLE math without algebra is doable but yes more difficult compared to simply using algebra. There are certain assessment books out there, which have very good problem-solving approaches to PSLE questions. (The one by Fabian...) Basically you have to think out of the box for certain questions, but that makes it fun doesn‚Äôt it? I feel like the road from PSLE to A levels, Math just gets way and way more dry and boring.', 'I get you mean, I am international students so I have to learn psle stuffs before entering sec 1 and I was suffering. I found sec 1 was so much easier and I think that it was because I actually had teachers to teach me sec 1 math whereas I had no teacher for psle math. Eventually, I took O levels and quite confident with my math as I scored A1 for both. Then, some foreigners asked me to help them with psle math because they are trying to get inside sec 1 here as well. I got to say, psle math is still bs. Especially all those words problem, like how do you even use models and ratios to solve ? I got so frustrated at one point and told them to just use algebraic method because it‚Äôs so much easier.

In p5&6 I‚Äôve never gotten less than a 96 for a math paper because they all seemed like common sense to me, but I‚Äôve been getting my ass kicked really hard by sec sch and jc math and no matter how hard I worked I‚Äôve never done well. I wonder why...', 'i agree that some questions in the current psle math is quite challenging, but i felt that for my year, it was somewhat easier ? \n\ni did well for math in pri sch, as well as psle, yet i still failed/barely passed emath and amath from sec 1-3', 'I feel you lol, my younger sib did PSLE last year and dang those model things are dang troublesome.

A lot of it just requires a ton of steps but for me just paying attention especially when learning about the use of pi and radius for area of circles is enough to solve those questions. Although maybe it‚Äôs just my experience, I found score A* in Maths relatively easy, honestly scoring A* in science is much harder because they ask questions that aren‚Äôt taught and requires out of the box thinking which isn‚Äôt usually taught in science since science is founded on facts and logic and not really on assumptions.', 'agreed. psle needs brains, practice and understanding while o level and a level math is just practice and understanding thats all', 'Yet, they still told us that if you get correct answer for Guess and Check in the first try, you need to fake an error twice.

[O Levels] I don‚Äôt want to drop Pure Science because I want to go to JC (Arts Stream),O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586172066.0,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm an ‚Äòinternational student‚Äô (but I grew up here) currently Sec 4 taking the typical Pure Science stream. (Bio, Chem, Amaths & Emaths)

Mentioning that I was an international student was relevant because of the fact that I don‚Äôt take Mother Tongue. Instead, I take a 3rd language (French) which I‚Äôm currently doing very badly in lmao

With that said, that can only mean one thing‚Äîif I were to drop to Combined Sciences, it‚Äôll be nearly impossible for me to go to a relatively good JC unless I do extremely well for French. (I‚Äôm currently scoring an E8 lol)

I‚Äôm not doing very well in my Sciences either. I largely blame that on my lack of effort last year. However, right now, I‚Äôm trying much harder to push myself to score better and although I do see improvement, I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs enough.

I‚Äôve only started to buck up at the start of this year and I don‚Äôt think that the slow development in my grades is not a telltale sign that my efforts will be enough to actually do well during my O Levels. I wanted to use the upcoming Mid-year Exams to gauge how well I was coping with my newly reformed attitude (lol) but due to the COVID-19 outbreak, my plans were all ruined.

So now, should I...
- Drop Pure Science since I‚Äôm not coping as well as I should be & there‚Äôs no way to assess if I‚Äôll ever be able to cope with its rigour due to the cancellation of MYE? (Which would mean that to get into a good JC, I would have to do exceptionally well for my 3rd language which isn‚Äôt very realistic)

Or should I...
- Stay in Pure Science and continue to grind with no way to tell if I‚Äôm doing enough and just hoping for the best that I‚Äôll do well during Prelims.

Currently, I‚Äôm aiming for an A1 for both my English and Humanities and A2s for both of my Maths & in my Sciences to go to an Arts Stream in JC. (Yes, I don‚Äôt plan to continue with my Sciences if I were to get into JC) and if I were to score anything greater than 15 points, (raw score) I would much rather go to Poly instead.

I appreciate all of you for taking the time to read this long post. Thank you all!

P.S. Tuition is not a viable option for me. My family‚Äôs income neither earns too much nor too little. It is suffice and cannot support me if I were to go for additional tutoring.

That‚Äôs really the biggest dilemma right now', 'Yep, But if I score perhaps a D7 (bare minimum for MT) for French while I‚Äôve (hypothetically) aced every other subjects, that‚Äôll still give me a 12 point aggregate. \n\nThe main problem is do I avoid French (which I know I will flunk) or do I take a risk and work for 2 A2s (which I might not even get?)\n\nEg.

So I just gave up on mt and decided to focus on my sciences cause I prefer having  that sense of security.', 'The thing is now is only the start, as long you put in the effort, distinction is achievable. In addition, due to covid 19 marking may be more lenient and the bell curve may be lower/less steep as well. I mean you never knoee. Imo it‚Äôs up to you,it‚Äôs your decision...if you drop to combined science most probably you‚Äôll end up with A1. If you avoid French , which I believe language is rather harder to improve compared to Science you May also score distinctions for both your sciences if hard work is put in. You might also wanna think about why you‚Äôre scoring a certain grade for your sciences. As someone who dropped from pure Chem (F9) and pure Bio (B4) before prelims to combined science (A1 for Os) all I can say is that the diff between pure and combined chem is rlly huge. My math sucks so my pure chem suffered. Combined chem is more towards memorising and application (math is very minimal) so I managed to score well for combined chem. The reason why I dropped was bc I was sure I didn‚Äôt need science for my poly course (you might also wanna keep your options open for now, no harm considering poly) \nAnyways, you can think about it (whether for you it‚Äôll be easier to improve your sciences / French etc) then make a decision which to drop/avoid , I did have classmates dropping to combined sci / A Math even after prelims so yeaa...I also did have classmates who got B3/4 for both their sciences but dropped to combined science bc they knew they wanted poly and wanted a lower L1R4 for Os', 'ahh i‚Äôm sorry i must have misread it!! well i guess it rly depends how much you want to go to a ‚Äúgood‚Äù jc?

telegram user : mochiineko 
attached i have some studying tips as well for any who might need it ! 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
1. throw your phone somewhere , put it in airplane mode or if u have forest , use it !!
- trust me , all the texts / notifis rly hinder the revision process , i know you‚Äôve probably heard this a billion times but it does help ! if you‚Äôre someone ( like my dumb self ) who needs google , mute all the social media apps ( or if you‚Äôre on apple , lock it w screentime !) and limit urself to use it solely for school !
i have friends who also asked their parents to confiscate their phones  üò•üò• but i wasn‚Äôt gonna do that to myself LOL
2. notes are actually useless .
TRUST ME IT SOUNDS STUPID BUT notes are only useful if they are YOUR OWN ! we all learn / digest knowledge in our own ways , so unless the note set is made by you to cater to your own knowledge gaps / parts u struggle understanding , it‚Äôs a little useless ( unless u have photographic memory ;-; pls teach me how ) ! so ! even it takes a whole lotta time to make ur own notes , i feel it‚Äôs p worth it if u uds what you‚Äôve written ! if you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôve written , highlight those parts out and ask questions or review them !  if you lack time / spend too much time making such sets , remember that ur notes only need to be KEY POINTS and not the entire textbook, condensed :( , aNd it doesn‚Äôt have to be pretty ! ( ok shoot me cos i love making pretty notes but if they hinder you... pls don‚Äôt... i promise u can make them pretty if u have time !)  ( also if you‚Äôre a visual learner BONUS POINTS cos u can draw out diagrams ! if you‚Äôre not ... I HAVE MORE TIPS )
3. YOUTUBE VIDEOS 
oh yes, i have many teachers who ! don‚Äôt ! explain ! well ! so what do i do ?? go on youtube and search for videos that explain such concepts ! i loved using crashcourse for chemistry & amoeba sisters for biology (bonus is teded but i usually watch it in my free time LOL) it also rly helps bcos of all the animations 

‚Äî‚Äî
i have many more tips that i can‚Äôt think of at the moment but i will compile a google docs when i have more time ! 
i hope i have managed to help any of you out there :)

[Scholarships] CN Yang Program & NTU CS vs Nanyang Scholarship & NTU CS,Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1586162784.0,"Hi guys, I am currently having a dilemma here and want to hear from different perspectives. I am looking to specialize as  a software engineer perhaps specialising in the fields of Machine Learning and AI. Was offered NTU CS with regular Nanyang scholarship or CN Yang Scholarship program with CS.

Pros and Cons of CN Yang Program that I can think up of:

Pros: Provides for alot of opportunities, networking chances and prestigious (Not sure about this wrt companies). Research experience might prove to be useful in the fields of AI and Machine learning.

Cons: Learn stuff such as triple science etc during the first sem, might fall behind other cs students and career wise (Because these modules are very heavy in content wise = spending less time on cs mods and less free time for personal projects). Also curriculum wise suggest that uni breaks will be spent on things like making & tinkering etc = Less time for self-sourced internships, and less elective slots.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvv8cl/scholarships_cn_yang_program_ntu_cs_vs_nanyang/,0,"[""Hello, CS + CN Yang student specialising in AI/ML here.\n\nFirst let me address some of your cons. Yes the first semester has triple sciences but I feel that it has not resulted in me being left behind at all. In fact I'm actually happy to have the triple sciences modules because they are practically in place of UEs and as long as your foundation from JC is there, you will do more than fine. Imagine getting free As and A+s from just knowing your JC content + a little more, pretty good deal to me. \n\nIn terms of modules compared to other CS students, you will be behind by around 2 modules after semester 1, but you can make up for it if you overload the next semester. If you are caring about personal projects and career at this point, there should be no issues with you knowing your CS basics, so all is fine.\n\nOnly the first year's summer is spent on M&T and you can see M&T as one of your personal projects too by incorporating your major into it (which is what I'm doing). Usually companies do not want Year 1 students as interns, so that internship clashing with M&T should not be an issue. \n\nAs for the pros, I'll talk about them from my point of view. Taking the multidisciplinary Year 1 was actually really enjoyable for me because I got exposed to so many different perspectives that aren't just limited to CS. I got to see how CS, and more specifically AI can fit into all the different disciplines and in this day and age where literally every person without an interest is going into CS and planning to specialised in 'data science', having these small edges of knowledge can be a very good advantage over the average CS graduate. \n\nMy research experience so far has been very enriching, cause I got to explore an area of ML which is rather new and there are very few people out there who actually work on it, and NTU has one of the few research groups doing it. To some of my friends, going straight into AI research is kinda like baptism by fire, for the lack of a better phrase, but it gave us a lot of valuable experience that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise until what is probably Year 3 or 4.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of the other pros of CN Yang like the close knit community and all, so I shall not expound on that. \n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to message me :)"", 'May ik what your rp is', 'How did u manage to get the general nanyang scholarship also when u hv alr gotten the cn Yang Scholarship?

[poly] a rant,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1586161989.0,"hello im not sure yall have came across my posts on reddit regarding my admission of poly but i previously had an issue with my enrolment and ranted it here. true enough RP admission office had completely forgotten about my enrolment. called them multiple times but their replies were not helpful at all, sent many emails but did not received any reply. 

long story short, i know a lot of RP students also facing issues because they did not receive any information or received different information from the majority.  

im actually really pissed off at the admission office because they called us back for an induction programme this week and they have not told everyone the time slot they were allocated to...thats like so last minute and theyre making everyone anxious zz. 

eventually most my problems were settled and i‚Äôm just waiting for a final email before i can configure my laptop. 

i have compiled all the different stories of people having bad experience with the people in RP. you judge for yourself.

[ story 1 ] : this girl called the IT dept and was told to school because she was experiencing some admission problems. when she got there, they took down her contact details and they told her to go home and wait. wasted trip. she could not do anything else but to wait.

[ story 2 ] : my friend applied for dae to school of applied sci. a week after the scheduled interview dates, he received a call from rp saying that they missed out his email, and will arrange an interview for him soon, as well as sending an email to notify him by the last day of march. you‚Äôve guessed it, they did not contact him ever since.

[ story 3 ] : this girl had problems with her laptop after configurating it. she gave rp a call and continuously for 15 mins the staff told her to factory reset her laptop, and this girl insisted that she already tried doing so but would not work. the call ended after she argued with the staff. the next day she went to school to solve the issue.

[ story 4 ] : another girl similar issues to mine and she called the office this morning, the staff told her that they will send an email with regards to her configuration of laptop by today. its 10.26pm and you know whats the outcome.

i can confidently when two people call the office and they ask the same questions, they will receive two completely different replies. im not the only one having a bad experience. 

these few days my contact with rp admission office left me speechless. there was not a point in sending them emails because they simply dont bother to reply unless its extremely urgent. they would also missed out some student admissions, but i dont blame them for that because theres alot of people applying. 

one thing they did unforgivable was that they dont send emails or sms by the deadlines, and when they‚Äôre sent out its super last minute. i understand that they sent it out by batches but i think they need to be more efficient. its quite stupid if they send out notifications last minute.

my biggest worry is that they will forget to send me the email for laptop configuration, and i would not be able to seek help because there would be no one in the office as they staff may be working from home. it might caused me to not be able to access the apps and complete my hbl, thu affecting my grades. in the event if this actually happens, i swear im gona give them Hell. im so tired of their nonsense.

[O levels] Dealing with feeling inferior,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586158903.0,"I feel so demoralised and tired after seeing students from elite schools getting straight As despite them being from elite schools, meaning their papers are more difficult/rigorous.

I don‚Äôt know why but I just feel so overwhelmed, like everything is piling on me. 

I‚Äôm getting no where with my studies. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm already losing sleep for studies, I‚Äôve already did whatever I can, but it‚Äôs still not enough.

It‚Äôs not my fault I learn slower , not my fault if my mother tongue is not English(haish english......),but yet I‚Äôm bearing the consequences of them.(Ok I sound unreasonable and whiny, I just really need to get this off my chest.)

This general feeling of inferiority, jealousy and even contempt towards myself is slowly taking a toll on my emotional health and grades. I find myself blaming genetics(omg eww I‚Äôm sorry for thinking this üòî) and being very pessimistic towards life in general. I know this mindset would definitely not serve me well in the future, and hence am trying change.

How do y‚Äôall deal with this feeling?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvuh9x/o_levels_dealing_with_feeling_inferior/,12,"['is okay to be a slower learner \n\nas long you dun give up on yourself. everybody can say you cannot or you no good but you cannot give up on yourself. \n\njia you :) anyway can PM me or check my profile for my study exp.(I am a slow learner too)', ""Hey there! I took O-Levels last year and all I can say is that you should never give up. I suffered from burnout and depression at the start of sec 4 which made it really hard to focus on my academics as I often found myself digressing into self-doubt and fear of losing out to my peers. \n\nHowever, it was through this that learnt many things about coping with negative emotions:\n\n1. Don't push the blame - regardless of whether the situation that \nyou are in is your fault or not, realise that heaping guilt unto      yourself or others will do Nothing to solve the issues you face learn to ignore such sentiments and focus on your work.\n\n\n2. There is hope as long as you don't give up - Things may seem\nbleak right now as your world may burn down around you. Still, its\nnever over until you decide to give up. As long as you remain focused and motivated to press on through the pain and doubt, your effort WILL show in your results.\n\n3. Learn to enjoy the process - As difficult and far fetched as it may seem, learning to develop a liking for the process of preparing for O-levels will make it easier to cope with the rigour of doing so. I had a friend who is now in an elite JC who used to practice A math everywhere he went, even on the school trip we went on after our exams in sec 3 on the food tray in the plane! To him, he loved practicing as he knew his every effort would pay off which is why he no longer saw it as a burden to practice but instead a part of his daily routine. (He finished the Amath paper 1 in ~40mins so that practice definitely helped)\n\n\n\nSo here are some things I have learnt in secondary school which I found worked for me in preparing for exams in general. I hope that you find out what works for you and succeed in implementing those strategies.\n\nHere's wishing you all the best for O-levels and a memorable journey with the time you have left in the run up to it!"", ""Well... There are late bloomers. There are people who are contented with simple life. There are people who don't mind working harder to reach their goal. \n\nI guess it depends on what you treasure, and whether or not you can take some hardship. I didn't start off in elite schools as well, my secondary school results were shit until I put in effort, and as long as I'm happy with my family now we're ok. Nothing about those high flier to get jealous about. \n\nSo, maybe ask yourself truthfully, what is it that you treasure? And whether or not you need to rethink about what you treasure?"", 'Don‚Äôt have to compare yourself with others. You are what you are. Some people are just great at studying. Some are great at sports. While others are jack of all trades, master of none. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI‚Äôm really proud of you for trying your hardest. Set a mini goal for yourself to achieve, such as getting a grade higher from your previous test. Then, reward yourself for it, such as buying a gift for yourself etc. \nFor me, I find studying with my close friends more effective as they would encourage me and just have fun while learning. \n\nIn life, It‚Äôs a pathway to becoming the best version of yourself. Exam results do matter but you would have no regrets that you already tried your best. Again, comparison does not help at all and it will only cause unnecessary stress and pressure for yourself.

You just have to put more effort on those subjects you find hard. \n\nWhen you study, plan it well. Schedule in such a way that in a week you can cover all subjects. Make sure not to overwhelm yourself when studying. Take one topic at a time. Make us of your lifelines when you can't get it in your own...maybe from your friend who is really good at it or from a tutor.

Please help me with your honest opinions üò£ SUSS and kaplan uni students would be a plus so I have a clearer understanding. My arguments are:

1. SUSS is a 4-year course while the same degree in a kaplan uni is a 1.5-year course.

2. SUSS is mostly self-based learning and students don‚Äôt go to school often as compared to other local unis but pay about the same school fees.

3. A kaplan uni degree is just for completing the degree while at SUSS there‚Äôs overseas exposure, internship, and CCA to hone skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvrnpj/uni_is_suss_or_a_uni_in_kaplan_better/,21,"['I‚Äôm not familiar with either but I‚Äôll definitely choose SUSS as it‚Äôs a government uni. \nUnless I can‚Äôt get into my dream course in SUSS then I‚Äôll consider doing it in Kaplan. \n\nHowever, I‚Äôll prefer SIM GE to Kaplan as it‚Äôs a more reputable Pte Uni. The courses are normally 2.5 to 3 yrs. \n\n1.5yr for a degree course is too short for anyone to gain enough knowledge. As an employer, I‚Äôll doubt the value of this degree. Sorry folks from Kaplan. Just my personal opinion.', 'Here‚Äôs my opinion, as someone from a technical discipline in a standard 4 year local uni, with a pretty fast paced curriculum. I don‚Äôt have much knowledge of SUSS or Kaplan, so take it with a grain of salt please!\n\nWould I have considered myself to be ‚Äòhire-able‚Äô material 1.5 years in? Definitely will not be considered for any full-time position, qualified for internships (but will be fighting for it against everyone else). Simply put, I think it‚Äôs rare for someone to be able to develop meaningful competencies in 1.5 years to be competitive in the job market. So SUSS would be better of the two.\n\nOf course, if you‚Äôre looking at social science courses, the above may not apply.', 'SUSS. But it really depends on what you are looking for. Do you want to fast track your education and get to the workforce faster? If yes, then Kaplan would be ideal. \n\nOh but you mentioned about other unis! Is the date where  you have to accept/reject the course coming soon? If not, maybe hold on for a little longer ! You never know what will happen!', 'I would recommend you look into your prospective employers and cold call/email them and ask whether they will accept a Kaplan University degree.\n\nWhile the others have shared that a 4 yr experience at SUSS might be more comprehensive and the degree is more recognized, at the end of the day, IMO the main purpose of the degree is simply a piece of paper to get you into your desired job. Reason being that workplace experience is far more important than whatever the university teaches you. Especially when it comes to SUSS which does not necessarily offer the experience of a traditional university but is *IMO a degree factory (similar to Kaplan university) IMO* for working adults to obtain certifications hence the ‚Äúself-study‚Äù reputation it has.\n\nSo long as that degree fulfills that function (and seeing as you will save a significant amount of time at Kaplan granting you more time to advance your career), I feel that it is totally a logical option to choose Kaplan with the qualifier that the degree is recognized by your prospective employers which it should be for most private sector employers. \n\nCost should also be weighed into your decision though I think they should be about the same.', 'Suss because its a local uni and they make sure that u have experience overseas and compusory work attachment which makes it easier to find jobs in future', 'SIM , SUTD....better choice...Both SIM UOL or RMIT...very reputable...But SIM UOL is 100% exam based and some companies prefer UOL degrees.I have friends grade with UOL degree and working in the foreign bbank.But tough because is 100% examination based...', 'Definitely suss, its recognized as a local uni, can secure jobs faster', 'Choose a program from SIM or SUTD...', '[kinda related reply i gave previously to someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftz04t/uni_going_to_a_private_university_sim/fmb2irk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nok. depends on what you want to study.\ndo you have the funds.\nlocal uni should be prioritised as far as possible. it has tuition grant fyi. suss is more for working adults. aka a cert to value add people who already have working experience.\n\nalso, most of my friends went SIM global education/GE. i\'ve done a sem there as well. becos out of all private unis, SIM links is sorta the most recognised in a sense/or you could take things with a pinch of salt/most friends are doing totally fine.

The amount of time you study is not a good indicator of how well prepared you are and how able you are to get an A1.\n\nFor subjects like math, science & POA I instead feel that a good gauge is finishing practice papers well before the timer ends and getting very high marks without checking for carelss mistakes, i.e E math paper 1 is 2 hours? Aim for almost full marks in 1 hour. Careless mistakes are weeded out with practice and a calm mental state (a must have for Os!)

It's a tricky one, read model essays (and examples if u do argumentative) or read random descriptive words and have a vivid imagination if u do personal recount/descriptive essays. As for Paper 2, just keep grinding papers until u can get a high mark that is beyond the A grade to be safe.

Underline keywords and sentences to help you understand certain parts of the text, and if you have to expand on certain parts of the question (especially for essays), do it. No one is stopping you.\n\nNot only that, try reading up on various topics in the news, or if you're more adventurous, read up to gain further knowledge about the topics that really interest you on wikipedia, forums or blogs. You may never know what'll come out in your actual paper. This gives you content to use for your essays, in the form of examples and points.\n\nLastly, I feel that this may be underrated, but fortify your foundations on the technicalities of English. I know that using flowery and bombastic language ie. 'I serendipitously stumbled upon my long-lost cousin at the market yesterday.' can attract the eyes of Cambridge markers, but without a decent foundation in English, there's no use for a thesaurus. Study and know the rules of grammar, like which prepositions and tense to use by heart, such that it almost becomes like a reflex when you do editing questions. Try aiming for close to 0 grammatical errors for every essay you hand in to your English teacher. Only then can you try being a bit more creative and explorative with your writing style. \n\nIt may sound a bit daunting, but with practice, it is possible to achieve all of this.\n\nTl;dr: understanding of the text, reading up more widely, and strengthening your foundations are what will help you score your A1."", ""The hours should not be your gauge though you need to allot time for each subject.  \n\nWhat you need to do first is prioritize your subjects.

So here's a version for the more of arts subjs students.

I'm comfortable helping with History, Lit, Math and GP, also H3 Hist (technically we're not supposed to, but if you just want someone to bump ideas with on the direction of your paper, feel free to pm. Econs, man I can try but this is like 60% assurance, and much of it will be my speculation. 

The rest of the questions, esp like History essay question breakdown/analysis, it'd be nice to post here to make a whole stack! If you're shy you can pm, but I'll copy paste (lol cc) my reply to here.

Any other people who did arts subjs welcome to join :) I hope that even though there are no more MYEs for you all, and this coming moth of HBL, you will stay motivated and study steadily without burning out. This is such a new situation so honestly, can't blame you (and don't blame yourself!) for being anxious. Good luck!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fv71xg/a_levels_willing_to_try_and_help_if_people_on_hbl/,14,"['From a HELm:  just want to ask for study tips? \n\nHello! Wow okay, study tips are a very broad and general thing, but for the arts subjects, need memorisation, understanding and speed. \n\nFor history - make sure you analyse a lot of past year questions, get to know what question means what: ""to what extent"", ""do you agree"" ""evaluate"" ""was more important than"", all these have different nuances to the number of minimum points you have to write.\n\nFor history, I\'d say, uh, you can specialise but please, no spotting. (Cambridge threw us a Secgen question and first decade, then also no AFC) \n\nFor everything in general, I\'d say know what makes you motivated - for me, I like reading fiction, and watching dramas, then outdoors things I like to look at plants -> When I feel like I\'ve done enough work, then I relax to reward myself. This gives me something to look forward towards and makes studying less tough.  Also, try to do work consistently, don\'t spam papers because you can burn out, making you lose more time than if you just went slow and steady.  \n\nNext, I tried to clear all my content problems by mid of the year, talk to teachers, friends, re-read notes and relearn concepts if needed as early as possible. This is because if now, while practising you cannot do one topic then suddenly the panic sets in and you\'ll freeze up. Mark out beforehand the things you are not so good at, spend more time (eg . math OMG vectors please relearn it fast fast,) \n\nDo also remember to breathe. Yeah. Feels like a mad dash, but really a lot of things will be up to fate. Make sure you know your things all the way to the bottom. Understand the why and how, then in the future, any question can reapply your previous knowledge to.', ""From H1 lit student: Looking for suggestions on how to improve for lit, not sure how to be more familiar with content and constantly not having enough time during papers\n\nTo familiarise yourself with the content, the best possible thing you can do is read your texts often -> can't emphasise enough that even though we don't need to memorise, during the exam, flipping book to find the quote is one of the biggest time drains. \n\nI mean it's not going to be the end of the world :') but you really don't wanna have to flip flip your book like crazy during the actual A Levels. Still, I feel that the best sort of literature revision is just reading and re-reading your text. Unfortunately or not, h1 has fewer texts, so less to shuffle. I would rotate my texts, reading the ones in the same paper together in the same week. \n\nEsp for H2, your text comparison requires you to draw links between your texts, reading them back to back helps - do it until the point where you can imagine words in one text appearing in another in your dreams!\n\nAlso would advise not highlighting/underlining until you have a solid system in place, so you won't regret or have a messy book that you don't understand later on. Best time to do this is during June hols, all the way up to prelims!"", 'For h3 history, did your sch give u any tips on how to structure your essay? Am quite clueless HAHA', 'From \'need massive help for history H2\': Cannot do SBQ, especially part b tips\n\nOkay, for sbq, I think the most important thing to find out now is where your problem is: 1. Not enough ck 2. Not enough time/not writing fast enough. 3. Cannot understand the source/misinterpret (also important to note if you have more problems with which type -> the text chunks, cartoons, stats) 4. Not a \'rigorous\' analysis 5. Not enough skills shown? \n\nFor the ck side, one of the best things you can do is get exposed to a lot of sources - there are many things the sources can show us that the lecture notes may not get around to covering. The first thing to do is to get your hands on the school prelim paper drive (link is floating on Reddit I believe) if your teachers haven\'t given. Because the ck for the sources will only be a tiny bit of all the content that you are going to be learning. \n\nRigourous analysis means being able to go beyond just paraphrasing which is usually enough to pass as long as you write quick! One of the best skills for this is ironically not your CK, since when we do papers often sucks that the CK we want to use appears in a source inside the set they give us!! Instead, the best skill is the cross-reference. Because the skills only need to appear once/twice for you to move up the band (like from L4 to 5/6) you need to display as many skills as possible. \n\nBest to find sources that pair well (usually from the support set one will directly contradict the challenge set, or be an academic article about the exact same thing, etc lots of possible relationships) after you prove the reliability of the first half, cross-reference back to that one while writing about the next. Eg. A, B, C are reliable (finish) Then in the challenge set reliability evaluation \'Source E says ...."" CR to source A, which is an academic discussing the speech in source E, reveals to us that the political considerations of the speaker in E make it less reliable...\n\nAlso, just practise a bit!! more, need time to develop the flair and sometimes gotta get lucky and be hit by inspiration about the source - like not just \'academic source\' but \'this institute is actually funded by the government\' - not just \'retroactive analysis\' but \'the anniversary of the event\', not just \'after the cw so the archives will be opened\' but \'this is the person recanting their earlier statement because now they are no longer in power\' \n\nIf you know your part a is fine, when doing papers don\'t need to waste time, just jot down the similarity, difference, explanations, don\'t need to write out in full when doing prac.

So no matter how badly you did, there's hope okay!\n\nFirst look and rank your subjects, then in each subject rank the different topics - know where you are weak in, what content, what skills, and focus on those.\n\nWhen you get demotivated, then practice something that you know you are good at to boost your morale - the amount of time you will spend on each subject really depends on how much that subject needs help, relative to your other subjs, but I would say it's good to touch all your subjects every week\n\nBest not to leave things untouched (eg. don't mug econs until no time to touch history, or do so many math papers until you toh and don't wanna read econs notes) cause the subjects can become a 'different language'\n\nThis is particularly true for Arts kids like us, because even though all our subjects are essay based, the kind of writing History wants, versus Econs, versus Lit is very different! :') I think it's self-explanatory that if you're doing CSC, CSE, CLLit, ELLit, Geogh, that they are different writings. So, even if they are your best subjects, don't forget them -> in fact, use them as 'reward motivation'."", ""Tbh, not really! There was no fixed 'format', but like you just write stuff and then go to your teacher supervisor to have it looked over. However, you can write with reference to either samples that your supervisor shows, and according to the h3 history syllabus doc.

It's sometimes fascinating to find the little things that the paper is designed to do, especially the Learning Outcomes which did actually push me into thinking harder about my topic.\n\nThe most plain format I can think of is:\n\nIntroduction, \n\nLit review (expansion of the one you did briefly in the proposal), \n\n\\[start of content\\] -> maybe about two/three headers on points you are doing research, the multiple answers/facets to the historical question you created, \n\nconclusion (where you should be tying up any loose ends/synthesising as well as weaving in the limitations that you originally identified -> this good to link to a future possible avenue of research to show that your question itself doesn't just stop, but provides even more possibilities in understanding the historical context and motivations. \\[end of content\\]\n\nacknowledgements are always nice, I feel, \n\nand finally bibliography, and appendices. \n\nBut really, the actual wording and structure depend heavily on your topic. Background-problem-reaction (with analysis inside) would be the summary of my paper, I did a geopol topic. If like eg. my friend did socioeconomic/dev. or one senior did art (like drawing art stuff), your topic headers may be more of context-issue-key figures-controversy-public reaction stuff like that.\n\n If have more questions, can pm!

With the release of the recent results, my cumulative gpa is 3.9 and above. I am from an engineering course in NP and is currently aiming to go to (most probably an engineering course in) NUS/NTU. Uni engineering courses typically have an average IGP of 3.6 in the 10th percentile and 3.95 in the 90th percentile. However, i did not join any CCAs at all (such as ambass/society also) and is not planning to in the span of my poly life. I was wondering if anybody was in the same situation as me and still managed to go to NUS/NTU in particular because i know that engineering courses might be competitive and a lot of people might have a high gpa, hence it might ultimately boil down to portfolio :')..... My classmates and lecturers also kept telling me that i might not be able to enter NUS/NTU due to this i just feel extremely disheartened..... But, i really do not regret not joining a CCA because i had more free time to do the things that i want and rest more too.

This allowed me to explore things i enjoy and not just join a CCA for the sake of making my portfolio look good.......",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fv4mu9/poly_chances_of_going_to_nusntu_with_no_cca_in/,10,"['CCAs are not needed at all.

as i withdraw from jae and accepted my course in dae, the enrolment portal was opened again till end of march. i have accepted the course, submitted the compulsory documents, and done everything that was needed. when my laptop arrived, i tried to configure it, however im stuck at the very first step because they said my student id doesnt not exist in their database. so i emailed the admission office for help and i was told that the email would arrive on 30th March, and i should asked the IT department for help if i still have a problem. its been a few days and i have not received anything yet. so i sent two emails to both the admission office and the IT department regarding this issue. today i called the IT Department, and they told me the issue lies with the admission office. so they passed the message and i have decided to give the admission office a call on monday morning, and possibly head down to sch in the afternoon or the next day to speed up the process

for the past few weeks, a lot of rp students have received a sms telling them that they can apply for a concession card at transit link website. i again did not receive anything. when i tried entering my ic number into the online portal, transit link told me that my data was not found in their data base. i have also emailed rp admission office about this issue.

can i just check if anyone is in the same situation as me? or you have been in this situation before? is it possible that i might have been left out? i have a friend who was told that the admission office forgotten to send him an email for his dae interview, and he was supposed to receive the email by yesterday but nothing came. 

* do note that i have checked my email, all inboxes, including those under spam mail.

i swear my anxiety is üìàüìàüìà and im already preparing myself for the worst. please help its rly bothering me a lot ‚òπÔ∏è

[UNI] My SIT Kira Interview experience (Radiation Therapy),University :snoo_smile:,1585997059.0,"Hi! I have just completed my SIT Kira Interview. While the experience remains fresh in my brain, I have decided to post what I have went through in order to help people who are going for this soon.\*\* Before my interview, I read through a fellow person's post about the SIT Kira Interview experience. It was a very thorough post and helped me a lot so I **will not** be repeating what the person has mentioned.

* It was 18 questions for me. The first question was not a question because the system just needed you to place your ID (NRIC / Passport) next to your face and say your full name out loud.
* You **do not** need to be worried about the sound quality of the recording. If the sound quality is bad, the system actually knows. The system would ask you to redo the question immediately. (It was like that for me at least!)
* For point no.2, I finished the assessment at 12p.m. sharp today. At 2p.m., they emailed me to ask me to redo the first question. That was because they could not confirm my identity for some reason. So please do **check your email** even though you finished the test already. This is important especially for the people who are only going to do this right before the deadline.
* There were scenario based questions. Unlike what I expected, the scenario based questions were not based on events that would happen in the hospital. There were a total of **two scenarios** but **four questions.** Both questions were not based in a hospital setting. Both scenarios gave me a position in the community (e.g. Grassroots leader) and a random situation and wanted you to roleplay. You play two different characters in the two different scenarios.
* There were quite a feel **what would you do / how do you feel** questions. Apparently, they said in the question that they wanted to see how people deal with adverse situations and difficulties. For example, mine asked me how I would feel and what I would do if I failed an exam and my scholarship was going to be taken away. Additionally, I had ""financial difficulties"" and how I would react and how I felt about this.
* They actually do ask you what you would do if you do not succeed in getting into this course! (I was totally not prepared and probably screwed this up)
* I was not prepared but please think about **someone** who influenced you a lot in your life (link it to your course). OR An **event** that has influenced you a lot in your life.
* Lastly, I would like to encourage all of you to be careful when doing this test. I have realised that when writing the 30 minutes essay question and when you are preparing the answers to the questions, the green camera light for macbook is still on. I went to do some small research and found out that if the green camera light is still on, the camera is still on. I am actually **not sure** if they keep a recording of you preparing the answers to your questions, but I am just asking all of you to be as careful as possible! Don't do anything weird that you wouldn't actually do in a face to face interview ok! (If I am wrong about this please let me know because I actually sneezed in front of the camera accidentally hahaha)

I hope this might help someone along the way! All the best to you if you are going to do this interview soon! I hope you get the course you want ok!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/furlve/uni_my_sit_kira_interview_experience_radiation/,13,"[""Hi, big thank you for the post üôá\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I'll be attempting thr interview tmr and Can I ask \n1.

Disclaimer: This is MY experience. Everyone's experience is going to be different because I don't think they are going to ask the same pre-recorded questions. However, I do hope you take something from this post. 

Tips:

1. Prepare your NRIC or Passport or 11B
2. Say your FULL NAME into the screen for the FIRST question while holding your identity proof
3. Look decent. If you are a makeup-wearer, put some light makeup on! The sun is actually right opposite me so in front of the webcam, it can reveal your imperfections. 
4. OPEN GOOGLE. YOU WILL NEED IT. TRUST ME. 
5. Fake confidence and make it believable. You will be nervous because you don't have a lot of time to research
6. Do your best! 

Interview:

Disclaimer - These are MY questions that I received. You might receive different ones and I will not be held liable if anything were to change or it feels like I short-changed you. Use these as a guide of the level of difficulty

Sorry I have like no gc left after A Levels but came across this question so I just give you general tips for this question:\n\ni) There are two parents, one at the back and one at front - and there are 7 remaining children. The order of the children matters, so you find the number of PERMUTATIONS of these 7, then multiply by two (because you can reverse the parent order for any of your permutations)\n\nii) You have 3 sisters, so you CHOOSE 1 of 3, and then consider the parentsisterparent group as one person for you to permute the new number of (2 sisters, parentsisterparent, 4 brothers) 7 people and finally also multiply by two (because again, can reverse parents order)\n\niii) Seats are indistinguishable means the seating in a circle formula (n-1)! or (n!)/n depending on which form you learn, they are the same -> basically, if they were in a line, you would do the n! but because the seats in indistinguishable, you divide by the n number of seats. \n\nThe 'no two brothers' makes you think of the slotting method, I found that drawing a circle with the number of seats helped me. So you have to 'fix' the position of the brothers, the 4 of them, and then you 'slot' the five remaining members in between them.

[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,:redditgold: MUST-READS: University :snoo_smile:,1585974513.0,"I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I‚Äôm not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (third choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don‚Äôt shame me, it‚Äôs fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there‚Äôs literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people‚Äôs portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler ‚Äì 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard ‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore‚Äôs/the world's best architectures and what makes them good.¬†Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‚Äòcan multiple hierarchies coexist?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?‚Äô and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question.¬†It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you‚Äôre trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‚Äòabstract‚Äô while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

[https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu](https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn‚Äôt want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‚Äòhm! Good enough‚Äô. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‚Äòis the first one from an anime?‚Äô and ‚Äòwas the third one a class assignment?‚Äô and ‚Äòwere the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?‚Äô (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‚Äòwhy do you want to study architecture?‚Äô and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn‚Äôt really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‚Äòso why is archi your third choice?‚Äô and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they‚Äôre applying for Uni.

I wouldn't say that I did well for all my subjects for WA1. I find that math, poa and fnn are the easiest for me to score a distinction but I'm not that good in my languages, I'm good in chemistry but I'm kind of struggling with physics which kind of frustrates me and honestly both my geog and ss teachers just can't teach (im sorry ;-;) I'm making my own notes for geog at the moment since my school doesn't give any notes for geog, and honestly I'm not sure what to study for ss other than just memorising the format. Im planning take amath (and maybe pure bio) as a
private candidate but I'm currently not doing well in amath, self studying amath apparently doesn't work well for me as I only know how to do the basic questions (sigh), I don't really want to turn to my math teacher for help either and my friends don't really have the time to help me as they are also busy. Pure Bio is not going so well either but I managed to do my school's paper and passed, should I start making my own simplified notes like geog?

Why do I want to take a math and pure bio?
Well it's because my aim is to go to a top tier jc and im planning to go to the science stream and I've seen that you require both pure science and a math. 

My aim is to get 6 points for o levels and I'm currently getting like 18..
Does anyone have a suggestion on what i should do? Should I just stick to my own subject combi or should I continue? Should I aim for something more realistic and just aim to go for a more easier to get in jc? I know being ambitious is good but I'm afraid that if I aim too high I might actually fall and be disappointed with the end result. The students in the better classes taking pure in my school aren't even aiming for something I'm aiming for.. 
I've told some of my friends about my aim, they don't seem to believe that I can do it either and my teachers don't seem to think I can even make it to a jc and told me to just go for a poly instead since its my level.. Am I being delusional?

[A levels] school closures,A Levels :snoo:,1585965299.0,I am taking Alevels this year. I can‚Äôt really study at home. How am I gonna survive 1 month? The HBL wasn‚Äôt even that good for me and I prefer lessons in school. I am quite weak in all my subjects. Anyone can give me some advice on how to study during this period? Really worried because I didnt even do well for bt and now I don‚Äôt even have mye to see how much I have learnt.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ful90l/a_levels_school_closures/,138,"['You can face time friends/ classmates while studying? They‚Äôre purely there to motivate you cuz if you physically see others studying you feel more motivated to study too. If you‚Äôre too shy to ask just search up ‚Äústudy with me‚Äù videos on YouTube, there are livestreams and 6-8 hour videos of ppl legitimately studying', 'hello! j2 here with science combi (physics). personally i have always preferred self-studying to lessons so heres my take on how to be productive with studying alone! some of these may be obvious but yea here goes:\n\n1. choose a good place in your house where you can sit and focus. have enough space for writing, a glass of water, and youre set. no need to be super neat (i am never)!\n\n2. listening or not listening to music is your choice, personally i find that on some days for some tasks the ""demand"" for music is different. when you are trying to learn new content or use your brain heavily (e.g. for math), i think no music is more likely to work better. but this is your personal preference! take some time to figure out what you need\n\n3. if there are videos, it is not necessary to watch them. coming from someone who has not watched a single tutorial/lecture video from my school (for any of my subjects), i find that it can be very slow to watch videos and learn, also easier to get distracted. instead, try to read the notes independently and attempt the examples. if you really need solutions to guide you through and there is no pdf solution (reading is definitely faster than watching), you dont have to watch the whole video! just speed to where the whole solution is, copy it down, and figure out independently why it works this way. this helps long term understanding than just watching and copying ! (ithink)\n\n4. dont wait to ask! at any instance where you are stuck on one question and have been thinking about it for a while, that is the best time to ask your friends or teachers for help! when the problem is fresh in your mind and you have thought about it, that is the best time to look at the solution and it is a lot easier to internalise what others teach you then. if you decide to put the question off, not only will you have to relook at it when you next ask, but you would not be fresh with all your thoughts when you receive an answer, which is less effective for learning.\n\n5. discipline! you dont have to study everyday for ten hours if you dont feel like it, in fact dont study when you dont feel like it. (without school i sleep for twelve hours a day and study for any amount of time between zero to ten hours inclusive, and hey im doing fine in school, so dont stress about not studying ""enough hours""-- theres no such thing!) i mean discipline as in you maintain focus and productivity when you decide to study, and dont let yourself off until youre done with your tasks. no matter how fed up you are about it, keep yourself there until you finish it, and you can relax better afterwards.\n\n6. working smart is better than working hard, take this time to try things out and work out a way which works best for you. for the two months before a levels, youll probably have to spend lots of time studying on your own, so its good to start trying now!\n\njiayous !! you can do this (:', 'For me, I just take out my water bottle and leave it on my table.

Interested in applying for nafa art teaching but as I have already been given a tuition grant in poly, I have to pay the unsubsidised school fees which is about 10k plus per annum and I cannot afford it. 

Would like to hear some suggestions on what kind of financial aid can I receive so that I do not have to pay that much. Or if there is any other alternative route in taking art teaching. Thanks!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu1cox/uni_interested_in_nafa_art_teaching_diploma_but/,2,"['Not sure if you‚Äôre aware but firstly art teaching needs an interview to showcase portfolio. If you do that part well, you‚Äôll be offered art teaching fully subsidised by MOE for the course duration otherwise it‚Äôs the regular payment\n\nIf you‚Äôre singaporean who‚Äôs overall family income might be staggering a bit, you‚Äôll be eligible for MOE bursary which would cover about half the cost ($1-2k+). \n\nOther option is to get scholarships. Can only get 1 once a year. The school isn‚Äôt very competitive and getting one in my opinion is not difficult if you top your own class. They cover 1 year worth of tuition fees which is darn good knowing that you‚Äôd still spend hundreds for art materials. Min 3.8 gpa score for 1 semester and overall 3.5+ cgpa to get one based from my experience.\n\nFortunately, the other route to art teaching is to directly enter NIE. I‚Äôm not sure about entry but while I was at the NTU gallery for art teaching, I talked to a mother tongue teacher who switched to teaching art so maybe that possible? \n\nHope this gives you some idea to plan financially', 'The fully subsidised cost is when you sign up a bond of 5 years with MOE right? It seems like applying through NAFA and applying through MOE is diff given that their application dates are diff.. I do not want to be bonded but is that the only option to avoid paying full fees of a whopping 19k?', 'The thing is applying with MOE actually lets you have the qualification to teach in schools unless that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want because the whole point of art teaching is to teach at schools. But not everybody gets it you know, only the best art students can get the fully subsidised option. An ‚ÄòA‚Äô for O levels might not even let you pass the MOE interview. They used to combine the interview with MOE but I think a change of system happened. I really think the bond is a super good option to secure a good job that lets you teach at secondary/JC after a couple years of experience. NAFA sadly has no follow up degree course for art teaching also.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to teach art classes outside, you can do that but it is not advisable in my opinion. Other diploma like fine arts and arts management can do the same. The students on their internships did teach children. There‚Äôs a thing with pay differences in the industry and the students were getting paid peanuts during their internship. If you‚Äôre going to cover cost with awards, you‚Äôd have to fight these people for the awards since they‚Äôre talented.\n\nAnd lastly I‚Äôm not going to suggest working part time. You can‚Äôt do that at NAFA. Absolutely not. Best option, study study study and sign up for the annual awards', 'Hey! Thank you so much for the well thought out reply it is very insightful. May I know how should I start building up my portfolio then? What kind of artworks should I showcase during the interview in order to get in? Also, will they decide to fully subsidised school fees right after the interview process or they still need to see my performance throughout my 4 years of studies?', 'Also, the NAFA application is until May 2020 but the MOE scheme side says that their JAE has already ended. Does this mean that I have to wait until next year to apply?', 'Well my friend that did the interview was good at oil painting and charcoal drawings but got rejected. Had a feeling it was the discussion that wasn‚Äôt good. Instead, she just got the scholarship and did fine arts. She did receive the non-subsidised offer but no point since she wanted to teach at schools. The art medium for the portfolio has to be somewhat basic. Oil paining, charcoal, pencil sketches, acrylic painting, clay sculpting (much less) etc stuff suitable to be taught at school. Definitely start your portfolio immediately but pace yourself so the work looks good.\n\nThey‚Äôll immediately let you know after the interview results. There‚Äôll be terms and conditions to follow but not sure. As long as you remain a good student should be enough.', 'I‚Äôm not sure about that.

[A Levels] should i drop out because of covid-19?,A Levels :snoo:,1585921668.0,"
im not ready. it‚Äôs fucking terrifying. 


i took BCME in my first year, then switched to HELM. i don‚Äôt regret the change despite not taking most of the arts subjects, in fact im doing much better. in j1 i was doing fine with 60 rank points (average A B Cs) and i thought i was finally on the right track with matching aptitude in the arts, maybe 2020 would be my year? 

well .. apparently not. IF i had graduated w my batch i could‚Äôve avoided this whole situation. due to covid: all subject teachers have closed consultations, even online chats like zoom are limited to 15 minutes bc my lit teacher has a 7 year old in the house. 

i didnt expect this at all.

my results have also all dropped and im hovering around S es despite so much hard work. especially h2 history and h2 lit.

ASR hasnt given ONE sample essay for history, and for h2 lit i really dont know where to start. 

these are my books: p1 (TGG, playing for time) and p3 (woman in mind, virginia woolf, regeneration)

i shouldve known ASR wasn‚Äôt a arts niche school, hell, we have one lit teacher for the whole h2 cohort. (p1) i hear of other schools getting so much resources but asr hardly gives any. we dont have homework every week aside from the occasional paragraph.

its been almost 2 years, we‚Äôre supposed to be gearing up for As but its just not happening. maybe im the only one feeling this? 

im studied hard, went in ASR with 9 points but my school really has to step it up on their lit department. there is no structure and every lesson feels like im being cheated of my grades. i keep trying to write essays for my teachers but they just keep putting me off. dont know what to do honestly üò≠üò≠üò≠ ive already wasted one year and i just want to get my grades. its really tough being a repeat bc theres so much pressure and stress that you have to do well. im pretty healthy mentally but the waves of anxiety are really making me sick

[A Levels] HBL is probably gonna make me rot at home,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585912263.0,"JC has been pretty hard on me. 

When I first stepped into JC, I was pretty stressed about a bunch of stuff, such as my choice for subject combi and cca. After that was settled, I began stressing out on my academics. I took combined science in o levels and have taken up 2 h2 science subjects in JC. I became stressed from the big jump in difficulty and depth of the topics, and there were stuff that was only taught in pure science that the lecturers assumed we knew about and I had to figure that out myself. 

But one of the reasons I am still persevering on is my friends in my og and class. They've been making JC life way more bearable and enjoyable and I always knew that they were also in the same boat. 

However, because of HBL today, I hadn't had any interactions with them, besides them asking about HBL matters. Moreover, I am a peripheral member of a clique I am in now, and I only talk to them at school and they'd normally do stuff like facetime without me (they're actually really nice ppl and I have nothing against them, I just haven't reached that level of closeness in my friendships with them compared to them with one another, don't misinterpret it as exclusion). 

And often times when I'm alone, a lot of negative and insecure feelings would cloud my thoughts and I'd often mumble deprecating things about myself. And given that HBL will start daily from next week, I have become worried about my mental wellness as I'd probably have very little interaction with my friends. There have been articles about how cases of mental health issues in people have spiked on the first day of lockdown in the UK, and I'm worried that my mental health will further deteriorate after the full HBL has been implemented. 

I don't need anyone's pity or sympathy or anything like that, because I just wanted to vent out my feelings. As much as I want to be closer to my friends at school and want to do all those close friends would do, I probably won't be able to because tbh I haven't really done that with my friends in pri or sec sch, what makes me think I can have such close friendships in JC life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu6j1i/a_levels_hbl_is_probably_gonna_make_me_rot_at_home/,41,"['take the first step and ask to skype or sth!! it may seem really daunting but its really worth it!! maybe theres other peripheral members in your clique too haha then yall can be close together.. if not just ask the entire group? you said that they are nice so they probs wont reject u and facetime between themselves (maybe they just think you wouldnt care to facetime them cus yall not close)', ""You can do it bro!!! Take a deep breathe and continue on. No one knows what will happen in the future so don't worry about not having close friends and focus on living in the present and pursue whatever goals you have.

[A Levels] Senior's Advice,A Levels :snoo:,1585909944.0,"Hi! In light of this whole HBL thing, I want to offer some advice taken from what I went through. I'm a senior who took A levels last year. One thing that's vv important to note is please don't get carried away and slack. In my J2 year, I took things free and easy even up till June holidays, then I realised I had much less time than I thought I did. (As in, I didn't study during June at all.) 

Yes, for those of you who are struggling in school for personal reasons or anything and are really happy about being able to ""take a break"", go ahead. Take the time to recharge. In fact, I do advise that everyone should relax. This is to prevent burning out. 

But do also continue to keep up with the syllabus and start your revision! I heard that mid year might be affected... as in cancelled. If this really comes to pass, it would mean that you'll only know how much you know at prelims. You don't want to go into prelims getting straight U's. By then, it'll be pretty hard to do well due to the time constraint.

Many people do not have the self-discipline to keep up with their studies even as they are attending school (not taking initiative to clarify doubts with the teacher etc, not doing homework, not listening in lecture). Fewer will have the self-discipline to bother with their studies in this season of quarantine. But remember that consequences await for whatever choices you make. I know quite a lot of people from different JCs who didn't do well (some are retaking right now). I also have friends who U-turned (drop to J1 during A levels) because they felt they weren't prepared enough. Not doing well for A levels is a very real reality for everyone. The reason will differ for everyone but do you really want your reason to be because you didn't study hard enough?

Eventually, many people do come around to trying hard when the A levels near. Sometimes, it's when they see their mid years. Other times, it's when they see their prelims. In this context, there may not even be a mid year exam and to wait for prelims would already be too late. My friend U-turned 30 days before A levels. He gave up before he even took the exam. A levels is a mental war and you don't want to have a self defeatist attitude and worse, it's justified because you KNOW you didn't study hard enough. My point is, there comes a time when there's a point of no return. Now is probably not that time yet. But that time always comes without us knowing.

By all means, take your breaks. Enjoy your hobbies. Spend time with your family. But don't use this quarantine season to run away from what you fear because problems aren't solved that way.

Support is also pretty important! You should probably continue to keep in touch with your classmates and friends because even if you aren't close to them/don't like them, you guys are still going through the same thing and it helps to not feel alone. If you don't mind, you can also talk to your teachers as well! You should probably talk to them about how you can complement your own learning.

PS: I probably sound pretty harsh because I'm the idiot who slacked and I know more people who are disappointed with their grades than people who are happy with them. And I know many people who are lazing around despite saying ""oh, I want to be doctor"" and it just doesn't sit well with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu622b/a_levels_seniors_advice/,31,"['i second op‚Äôs post i slacked till june too and paid the price when my myes were so shit had to work rlly hard to get back on track sometimes i will wonder how things will be different if i hadn‚Äôt slacked', 'Hehe thank you for the wise words!!

Never be complacent, always be prepared

There were signed petition for school closures.

Every student and teacher had a chance to go through Home based learning. Loaned out many laptops and WiFi to students who don't have. The exercise this week went smoothly. 

It is now time to move to full home based learning. 
From Wednesday, 8 April onwards, Home based learning until 4th May. 

Required to stay at home. 

School remains open to those who need support.

Exams: Do away for all mid year school exams. National exams are still essential and will continue.

O level MT exams will proceed. Year end exams no need to worry for now.

Marking will be adjusted to be more lenient and can apply special consideration. 

Student Care: Remain open for parents who need support with all the health measures in place, thermometer and etc.

Uni: All exam and homework assignment at home

Poly and ITE: New batch of students, first years, come to campus, register and get equipped for online learning. Students will be coming in small separate batches for the next few weeks. 

Advice: Try to learn outside of syllabus, find the curiousity in you and learn what you are interested in during this time (lol)

[O Levels] Scoring straight A1s in Secondary English and N/O Level English -- Paper 4 Oral edition,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585900214.0,"In this discourse today, I will be sharing some tips and tricks to study and prepare for N/O Level English Oral. Often, students are at a loss and do not know where to place their focus on for English Oral. As such, they often go into the exam with barely any preparation. In 2020, the syllabus for English Oral has changed -- information is now presented in a video format instead of a singular picture. Furthermore, many students are worried because the oral exam has been postponed as well. However, with the correct preparation technique, I believe that English Oral is an accessible component for students to score well in.

1. **When your preparation time starts**

10 minutes is not a lot of time, if I do say so myself. However, it is sufficient time to prepare for both sections if the time is managed well. Usually, I will allocate 3 minutes for the passage preparation. Read through once, and sift out the areas that emphasis has to be placed on. Don't dwell on the passage for too long as you will require more time to brainstorm for the spoken interaction. Watch the video very closely. 2-3 times would be advisable, and take note of every single detail. After watching the video, immediately start to brainstorm on your ideas and key points. More explanation on preparation for this part can be found below under spoken interaction so i will not delve into it here. 

**2. Reading Aloud**

""You can't prepare for reading aloud. Just go in and read the passage."" This is a common misconception that many students have. Due to our overuse of Singlish and sometimes, lousy English teachers \*cough\*, we get overly accustomed to pronouncing a certain word in a certain way. Fluency of reading is not difficult, hence examiners often pay extra close attention to the candidate's word pronunciation. Let's start with the most commonly used word, 'the'. If the immediate word following 'the' is a vowel (meaning AEIOU), 'the' is pronounced as 'thee'. However, if the following word is not a vowel, 'the' is pronounced as 'th-uh'. This is just one of the multitude of pronunciation errors that students make in the examination. To prepare for reading aloud, make a habit of searching up a BRITISH DICTIONARY (not American!!!) for the pronunciation of any word that you may be unsure of. I can't be listing down every single word here, but try to make a compilation of commonly mispronounced words and practice reading them out loud individually, then in a sentence. When reading, aim to make the words flow. Don't just look at the word that comes right after, look at the rest of the sentence that follows a particular word. This can make a difference especially when you have to decide which word to place more emphasis and stress on. You may think that it is a little too late to say this, but try to incorporate accurate word pronunciations into your everyday conversations. Correct your family members and friends when they pronounce a word inaccurately. It is the little habits that we can correct to make ourselves more proficient at the language. Another important thing to take note of is articulation. Pronounce all 'th' 't' 'k' well, reading each word slowly. DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PASSAGE. Be careful when pronouncing words like 'tests'. Articulation will come easier when the passage is read slowly, but be careful not to undermine the areas of the passage that require emphasis.

3. **Spoken Interaction**

Students' biggest fear. The key to this section of the examination, as many students don't realise, is to let yourself go and just speak. Even if you are shaking with nerves on the inside (i was too, don't worry), just calm your outer appearance and pretend like everything is fine and dandy. There are ways to prepare yourself so you can be much less nervous on the day of the examination. If we were to take a look at the ALL the topics Cambridge could EVER come out with for an oral examination, how many are there? If we narrow it down into broad categories to ease our preparation, I can only come out with a handful. Technology, Arts and Culture, Family, Money, Transportation, Health, Ageing Population, Education. These are practically the only few broad categories that they could ever test you on. So based on these broad topics, prepare a handbook of recent news articles and stories. Take a look at the 2019 O Level English Oral. They combined technology and education, asking about the use of computers for education. From here, you can start doing some research and reading up on how technology has influenced education in recent years. You could even bring up how tuition centres and schools have been using online platforms to teach during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Or talk about the regular Home Based Learning days that schools usually implement occasionally. With sufficient examples prepared, you can then move on to weighing the pros and cons of using these means. e.g. ""Yes, these online learning platforms are beneficial as they facilitate independent learning, training students to be more self disciplined to complete their tasks without having to go to school. However, it can be detrimental as the lack of supervision could result in students slacking off, procrastinating more, and may not be effective in educating them."" You could also talk about how technology is expensive, and students from lower-income households may not have the means to purchase a personal laptop for their studies, especially when there are multiple children in the same household. By drawing out a mental mind map of this thought-flow process, you will be able to, with practice, come out with points very quickly. With more practice, you will get the gist of the kind of possible questions you may be asked in the examination based on these broad categories itself.

Another method I found extremely effective is to hold conversations with people. I often converse with my mother, asking questions like ""What do you think of the government imposing a sugar tax on food and beverages with high sugar content?"" Conversing with others will help you widen the viewpoint and expand your horizons, giving you more alternate perspectives to a certain topic. This is especially helpful for those who have difficulty coming up with points to talk about. Garner as many different opinions as possible, so you will have an array of ideas at your fingertips.

Lastly, I must emphasise this. Good use of vocabulary is extremely paramount in spoken interaction. It adds colour to the point you are trying to bring across. I have mentioned how to improve your command of vocabulary in my previous post for paper 1, so I won't delve into it further here. However, an extra tip for English oral would be to come out with key helping phrases for yourself. For instance, one phrase to describe transportation would be that it 'forms the backbone of every nation'. With these key phrases, it will be easier to actively recall some possible points to answer whatever question the examiner asks. 

be calm and stay confident in yourself! don't let your nervousness get the better of you and just remember to articulate well in the examination! feel free to ask anymore questions that you might have and I will try my best to answer them as soon as possible. :"")",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu46ns/o_levels_scoring_straight_a1s_in_secondary/,19,"['thank you!! you have any tips for summary ? thanks:)', 'henlo!! this was super super helpful, thank you :‚Äù) is it alright for you to  make a HCL edition?', 'There are four lights!', 'yess!! i will cover when i do the paper 2 section :‚Äù)', 'ok to be very honest you can consult me on every subject that i‚Äôve taken except hcl because i‚Äôve not scored well enough to give advice HAHAH', 'im a little confused what lights HAHA', 'ohh that‚Äôs fine!!!

 I want to study education/drama. (Yes I know NIE is an option but I do not want to be a school teacher. I want to do something different.) I spent the last 3 years working in a student care and loved it. Now I want to take private a levels this year. Brand new.
I came from Poly but my GPA was 2.85. 24F this year. I am a linguistic person and like humanities. But due to some family problems my grades suffered from O level till poly. For O levels I scored A2 for English and B4 for Combined humanities. Yes, I know it's not stellar. But I'm older now and I am more focused. Another plus point is i can pick the subjects I'm strong in. Problem is....I know it's competitive. You have Raffles and other top JC students all competing. And I'm just a private candidate. And I feel quite old already. So question is, should I take this route?  Because i know I'll study hard. I'm just afraid I'll be discriminated against because I'm not from some top JC or even in a school. If not my other option is LaSalle Musical theatre because I hope to be a performer or a drama teacher next time. The other more ""practical"" (but not that passionate) option would be SIM BA communication/international relations.
 
Also I heard of some taking 4 H2s to be more desirable. I'm intending to take H2: Geog, Lit and Econs. (Maybe Bio). A question I have is do I have to take H1 Math, Chinese and GP? If l am aiming for overseas, i heard it's not needed.

Apart from what everyone else said, JC subjects are challenging to study and get straight A‚Äôs for even for students from top tier JCs. Even in those schools not everyone takes 4H2s. People who score 6 points raw in Olevels or IP students from top tier secondary schools still study for whole days with teachers‚Äô guidance and school resources and might not even get straight A‚Äôs. JC subjects are nothing like Olevel subjects (Olevel subjects barely scratch the surface, even more so if you got a B4 in combined humanities and want to take h2 geog in JC) and they‚Äôll be even tougher if you have no guidance at all and have not been in the habit of studying in a long time. It‚Äôs not the type of content you can just memorize like Olevels, you have to really understand everything very well especially if you want straight A‚Äôs. Idk if you know this but amongst JC students, Geog and Bio together is considered a suicide combination because they are both the most content heavy by far and by that I mean stacks and stacks of lecture notes that you have to memorize, internalize and apply. And practical is 20% of science subjects so keep in mind you have to know how to do them well for Bio.

But it's extremely hard to get through the entire process even with resources + mock exams that schools give you. I'm speaking from experience bc I absolutely hated the process of honing myself to be good at exams. Plus there are a lot of intricacies to the exams that you will only learn with proper resources like tuitions or school teachers. Spending money on tuition for all your subjects for As is a waste of money I feel.\n\nBut on a positive note, I believe you will figure your way out. Everyone has these moments where they are confused about everything. And don't feel bad about being 'old' and having nth figured out. There are loads of ppl out there only figuring out what their passion is in their 40s or smthin. Everyone is different.

If its the same then its not really an interview, more like a group discussion with other interviewees. You get a topic, read about it then discuss it with your group.

Based on what Ive seen u can pretty much tell whos getting in', ""You come in for registration and proceed to the waiting room with all the other students.\n\nThey will then move you into another classroom where you'll be sitting with your group. Here, they will give you an article to read and then discuss with your fellow group mates.

Talk your heart out but give chance to other students as well. After that, you're done. Now just wait for the email to see if you're accepted or not.

[O Levels] Scoring Straight A1s for Secondary English and O Level English-- Paper 1 edition,:redditgold: MUST-READS: O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585837295.0,"In this discourse today, i would like to share my tips and tricks on scoring well in O Level english paper 1. I have seen many posts about students struggling with english, and ultimately not scoring as well as expected in N/O levels just because of a low english grade.

As everyone knows, english is a compulsory subject taken into account in all grading systems -- EMB3, L1R4, L1R5, EL1B2R2 etc. Because of this, i just wanted to say that Cambridge will make the english paper accessible for everyone. Accessible, by no means easy, nor difficult. The paper is structured  in a way which helps to maximise students' grades for the subject itself.

**Paper 1**

1. **General Preparation Tips**

Firstly, I would like to emphasise a point that many often overlook. How many points have you lost due to carelessness, especially because of poor grammar? PLEASE CHECK YOUR WORK. The english paper 1 is structured in a way that gives you sufficient time to reread your essays to correct these mistakes. Minimising these mistakes can actually help you see an increase in grades.

Secondly, reading plays a huge, if not the biggest, part of paper 1 prep. The common question would be: "" what kind of content should i be consuming?"" Let's be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don't think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question. Something that i find extremely helpful are the Beyond Horizons magazines. i'm not sure if these are ordered in all schools, but if you have the means to, the subscription is worth spending the money on. The magazine offers an array of content -- from day-to-day experiences and stories, to tips and tricks for writing, and even comprehension and editing exercises. They offer fantastic reads in each volume and can definitely help in writing. Reader's Digest is also excellent in the content they provide. The topics discussed definitely struck a chord with me, and in turn offered me inspiration to manifest my thoughts and opinions in my writing.  Apart from these two series, keeping up with current affairs is also paramount to aid with coming up with content and examples in writing.

Thirdly, vocabulary. Vomiting all the vocabulary that you know is useful ONLY IF you use the words aptly. Certain words have nuances that we often overlook, causing the word to be inappropriately used in a certain situation, resulting in deduction of points due to 'WW' -- 'Wrong Word'. I personally don't have the superb power to come out with an unbelievably touching story or discussion that will move the marker to tears. Hence i depended on vocabulary a lot. I was so desperate to use as much vocab as possible in my writing, that i compiled a huge list of vocab words and their meanings, and crammed my brain with as many as possible for me to use in my writing. Learning vocabulary depends on how much effort you are willing to put in OVER TIME . It cannot be done a week before the english exam. So, if you are preparing for O/N Levels 2020, PLEASE START NOW. 

2.  **Editing**

The easiest section of the entire english paper. It's basically a free 10 mark section. The tricks are simple -- identify the keywords that will help you determine the faulty parts of the sentence. Setters always like to hide the mistakes at the end of a line, or the beginning of a line. Read well. The mistakes are not as difficult to spot once you have a grip of what's going on in the passage. That being said, do NOT rush into circling the mistakes immediately. Go through the passage once first, identify if it is in past, present or future tense, then proceed with attempting the questions. Nothing much to be said about editing, just be very careful as to not make careless mistakes. 

3. **Situational Writing**

Be very clear about the formats. Commit the differences in formal vs informal, email vs letter, news article, speech, to memory. You do not want to lose any marks because of wrong format. Next, annotate the question given. Take note of your Purpose, Audience and Context. These are all defining factors on how you should sculpt your writing. Make sure that you are clear of the question requirements. Break the requirements down, assigning them a paragraph each. After writing, make sure that your piece has met all the requirements (task fulfilment). One thing that many struggle with is keeping the tone. While writing, you have to consciously remind yourself to take note of the tone of your writing. If you are writing to a senior teacher, for instance, be very aware of the level of his/her seniority and sculpt your piece carefully. One more thing -- DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER. Only give yourself 45 minutes, capped at 50. You need much more time to plan your essay, so do not dwell on situational writing for too long. 

4. **Essay writing**

My favourite part of english. To begin, if you have ever been told to just focus on the style you're good at, please throw that advice out of the window right away. Cambridge is unpredictable. You could be fantastic at writing expository essays, but all it takes is one difficult and abstract topic to come out and you could be screwed over right away. Hence it is important to be versatile in your writing skills. While it is important to hone your skills in expository essays as they are more likely to be applicable in the future, it is equally important to be well-versed in the skills of writing descriptive, personal reflection and recount essays. The first step to attempting an essay of sorts is to come out with a detailed plan. Underline keywords, identify the important bits of the question, find out how you should elaborate on each content paragraph. Planning is an important step that many often overlook as they find it unnecessary. Having a plan will give you a clear idea of which direction to steer your story in. 

I will further break essay writing down into 2 parts, namely expository writing and narrative essays. 

For expository writing, start off by making the marker want to read your story. Make it intriguing. Draw the reader in and capture their attention from the very start. Personally, i am more well versed in descriptive writing, but i enjoy writing expository essays more. Hence, I often start off my expository essays with an anecdote. An anecdote is a short story, or an episode. By drawing in a personal example of your own, or creating a short but intriguing story, you will be able to effectively interest the reader right from the start. You can also start off with a hook, a quote, or a popular saying -- there are a multitude of story starters you could use. In your planning step for expository essays, you must prepare your points for your content paragraphs. This way, you can expound on each point once you reach that paragraph, facilitating a smoother thought process and flow in your writing. In a discursive essay, you should ideally have about 3-4 content paragraphs, while in an argumentative piece, you can have 2-3 points which are 'for' the statement, and one content paragraph for a rebuttal. I will not delve into how to write each paragraph. However, what i would like to touch on is the usage of examples in expository essays. Whatever you do, DO NOT USE THEORETICAL EXAMPLES. An example of a theoretical example is ""If a man uphold his rights and beliefs..."" Do not do this. Always have fresh and upcoming examples at the tips of your fingers. This is where the importance of reading comes in handy. You do not need to memorise statistics, but you need to provide a clear explanation which showcases your understanding of the example you have raised. At the very end of your essay, remember to balance out your points and give a conclusion that does not specifically point to one view, but instead sums up the points in the essay and give an equal weightage to each of the points raised in the content paragraphs. 

Most of the time, students avoid narrative essays. Personally, I would also choose to write an expository essay over a narrative essay. However, narrative essays reduce the likelihood of writing off-topic, which can cost you many marks. There is much less to unpack in a narrative essay question, as they usually ask you to ""write about a time..."", which involves some personal experiences to be brought in. It is easier to hit the content marks for narrative essays, so long as you meet the question requirements. However, in order to write a good narrative essay, lots of description has to be brought in. Think 5W1H. Producing a good narrative essay piece that 1) isn't too boring and 2) doesn't sound like a primary schooler's essay can be challenging. This is also where a good command of vocabulary comes in handy. To be able to visualise the scenario you are writing about is also paramount in ensuring that the reader gets the clearest idea that you are trying to bring across. When writing an essay on personal recount or personal reflection, remembering to bring across your feelings will help express the story better, making it less dry and unappetising. Keywords in narrative essay questions are also extremely important. Students must be aware if the question is asking for one instance, or for multiple episodes. Many students often miss this out, resulting in undesired content marks. Remember to conclude the story well and do not leave it hanging.

I have to say that it\'s very nicely written and am sure it will prove to be of good help to many in the near future. With that said, I\'d like to expand more on narrative essays since that was my focus during O\'s.\n\nDisclaimer: I\'ve noticed that Singaporean students tend to favour the expository/argumentative essays over narrative essays, so perhaps this is me pandering to a niche audience? I do, however, think that writing a good narrative essay can be picked up. The ability to manipulate and utilise the liberties of language will serve one well even into the future, especially during GP if the student so chooses to follow the JC route.\n\n# The Narrative Essay:\n\nBefore beginning to write a response to narrative essay types (henceforth referred to as \'NE\'), one must first *read the question*. It is a no-brainer, but many tend to overlook certain words or question requirements (e.g. A funny thing your *friend* did, A time you were *disappointed after being heavily expectant* for an event, A *person* you *admire*...).\n\nMany NE questions are conditional and the student must fulfil the first condition before proceeding to answer the question.\n\n**Content-wise:**\n\n*Smokability:* 7/10. Most NEs will give a vague description of an event or person and let you fill in the rest. I find it helpful to envision the skeleton of the event/person in my mind, then build on to that, starting with the question\'s requirements.\n\nExample: A person I admire.\n\nHere the question asks for a person (i.e. cannot be an object or group of people) that I admire (i.e. look up to, respect, aim to be like etc.). I would first think of people I admire, and see if there are any that I can just write about. If not, I would then think about good traits and smush them into one fake person. I would start with ""core"" traits -- characteristics I find essential to being ""admirable"". These core traits could then develop into further characteristics of an admirable character.\n\nDo be aware that ""admirable"" does not simply equate to ""good"", and over the course of the NE, you will have to show that these traits, in certain situations, made the person admirable.\n\n*Something to note: As people are invariably flawed, make sure that your smoked character (if you smoked it) has their own set of flaws, although you do not need to expressly state them. However, a character overcoming their flaws or outgrowing them (character growth!) could also be seen as admirable, so make of that what you will.*\n\nInevitably, you will be describing the person\'s appearance, and so it would be beneficial to have some vocabulary to describe them. You do not, however, need a laundry list of words to do so.\n\nSome areas to describe: The hair and state of it (insight into the way the person grooms him/herself), the way the person carries him/herself, the clothes he/she dresses in, and interesting things about them that might stand out.\n\nExample: *She was a willowy figure, slight of frame, though long in limb. Her eyes were the same muddy brown as her hair, which fell in smooth curtains down her head and flowed around her shoulders. She was not much to look at -- her face was plain; her clothes were simple and drab, and she seemed to curl into herself when she stood, shoulders bent inwards under the weight of the world. And yet, the ferocity of her gaze! What a marvel to behold; all at once, the waif of a girl was transfigured into a queen, all by the intensity of her stare. It was at odds with the smallness; the slightness of her demeanour and body, but it was all part of what made her,* her\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vocabulary/Description-wise:**\n\nI suppose the advice would be to ""show"" and not ""tell"", but I\'m not too fond of that myself. I believe that sometimes brevity is of the essence, and a ""tell"" can have more impact than a ""show"" in some cases. Short, snappy, and succinct, it will draw the reader\'s attention quickly, instead of drawing it *out*. Many scenes can benefit from a good ""tell"", and if you are running low on word count, find a way to make some descriptions less ""showy"".\n\nMany students mistakenly believe that long, extensive descriptions will net them marks in the NE. This is true to an extent, but without good content, and appropriate use of the big vocabulary, there is no benefit to be had. For example, throwing in 10 big words in a single paragraph has no gain if they are not used properly.\n\nFor the sake of being pedantic: Do not ""photosynthesise"" big words incorrectly.\n\ntl;dr: you do NOT need to over-describe. It is a *narrative* essay, not a *descriptive* one. The primary purpose is to *narrate*, i.e. ***tell a story***.\n\nI suppose 5W1H would help you, the student, to develop your writing to some degree, but this is more for planning than actually writing. You do not need to actively 5W1H your plan either -- as you think and plan, you will invariably end up doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Structure-wise:**\n\nA NE has a beginning, and end, and a body. There is no real ""structure"" in a NE, though many write it as though there is one.\n\nMy advice is to begin not by directly quoting the question ""...Here is a person I really admire..."" but to answer it *through* the essay. Easier said than done, I know. Here\'s an example I might do.\n\n1. Describe the person\n2. Something he/she did that I found admirable\n3. How my impression of them was affected/changed and I began to find them admirable (or any other variant)\n\nThere is no real limit or minimum number of paragraphs a student should have. As long as the story is told, and the examiner is not reading a wall of text, then you are generally good to go.\n\nParagraphing is IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Break up your writing!! You don\'t need to fit an entire event into one paragraph. It\'s ok to break them up. Save them eyes pls.', '>Let\'s be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don\'t think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question.\n\nIf I may contend with this:\n\nWhile ""storybooks"" and works of fiction may not necessarily present one with ""real-life"" current affairs content (in the context of an expository essay), I don\'t believe that one should dismiss them so easily. \n\nMany (older) works of fiction have writing styles and a certain use of the English language that may read ""smoother"" or be more ""pleasant"". They also utilise vocabulary rather naturally -- it does not feel forced, and the ability to do so can be learnt. It is by reading widely that we accumulate various writing styles and methods, so while fiction may not have immediate benefits in the realms of general knowledge, picking up on the style/language used would invariably contribute to a better language mark.\n\nThe paper is, after all, 50% language and 50% content. \n\nAs another note, reading widely (and hence including fiction) would provide content for questions about reading, books, philosophy... etc. They may not be ""current affairs"" material, but consider a question that involves discussing culture, traditions, and history. An older piece of fiction could be used as evidence to detail historical practises (with the explanation that works of fiction are often representative of the society at that time). Books on war, like Morpurgo\'s *Warhorse, Friend or Foe, Shadow,* and *The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips* may offer insight into the consequences of war -- on soldiers, on civilians, on society as a whole. And et cetera. You know how the argument goes.\n\nGranted, not everybody has the time to invest into fiction, so I understand when you say you did not read fiction in upper sec. I recall reading books I\'d already read before instead of branching out into new ones. Perhaps they are not the same situation, but I do see where you\'re coming from.\n\nStill, though, I think it\'s kinda unfair to say that they are ""out of the question"". I think there are benefits to be had, either directly or indirectly. \n\nBut again, I see your point. Just my two cents.', 'what assessments should i do?', 'Wished someone had told me this few years ago..\nThanks for the tips, some of them are applicable to General Paper too!', 'oral one coming soon! its always essential to be able to write essays in all styles because you can never predict what is coming out. sticking to one is risky. narrative essays are all about being aware of what the character sees, feels and hears (recall 5W1H).

[Uni][Poly]Messed up my life...need some advice,University :snoo_smile:,1585834740.0,"Sorry for the long text below.

Hi everyone, need some advice on how I should proceed with my current stage in life. 

I graduated poly in 2017 with a poly diploma with a cGPA of 3. Went on to serve NS (medical unit) for 2 years and ORD'd last year. 

I didn't really use my time in NS well to think about what I should do after I ORD and just wasted those 2 years away. Tried applying for SIT Comp Sci near my ORD date because of the demand for IT jobs and I thought that I would be interested in IT. But of course, with no prior educational or work experience in IT, I was rejected. Told myself that I would wait for the next SIT intake next year to try again and took up some part-time jobs in between.

Tried for this year's SIT Comp Sci and also applied for SIM Comp Sci. SIT didn't get back to me so I enrolled into SIM. After starting at SIM, I realise that I might not really be interested in IT and just sort of convinced myself because of the demand...right now I just feel like dropping out.

Currently, I'm thinking of doing something in healthcare or allied health (due to what I went through in NS) such as nursing but that would mean going back to poly for a diploma for another 3 years and I'm not sure if it's the right decision. Another option would be to find a full time job but I feel like no one will hire me because I don't have a lot of relevant work experience for the diploma. Really need some advice on what I should do.

I can't really eat and sleep properly nowadays because of this issue...I just wished I had not made so many poor decisions in life and messed it all up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftmhiv/unipolymessed_up_my_lifeneed_some_advice/,7,"['Looks like you really haven‚Äôt found your interest.

So unless you're loaded, going back to poly is probably not a good option.\n\nAn option you can consider is Parkway Health nursing! It's a private diploma and all their student nurses are sponsored by hospitals meaning you get an allowance every month with tuition fees paid and you'll be bonded to a hospital.

Volunteer at a hospice or seek a shadowing opportunity to find out if you truly want it. \n\nHowever, with the COVID-19 situation, it will be difficult to volunteer and interact with people so what I suggest is that you try to explore the courses available in different universities and list down a few you are interested in. Then, read the course module and take crash course on youtube to see if you like what you are studying. If you don't like what you are studying, it's better not to take that course or consider that path. However, if you are willing to put in the effort despite not liking what you study, then maybe it could still be suitable for you. Also, listen to talks by professionals on youtube to see what the job is like and what are the challenges in the job as well."", ""If you're thinking of health care you could try signing on in scdf as a paramedic.

   2. With reference to Politics and Economics, how should countries reduce the impacts of COVID-19?

Another said I should wait because what if a new better model comes out later in the year.

If I buy it now ...

Pros:
- Working at home sometimes and can use the laptop for meetings (current desktop don't have mic and webcam, encountering some difficulties)

- can use the laptop before school starts to install stuff and have fun customising it
- don't have the worry about no stock if that actually happens

Cons:
- shorter time of warranty because it doesn't start in August(I'd imagine using it more heavily in Aug) so maybe when it spoils (OH GOD PLEASE NO) I cry

[Poly] cgpa 3.1 what to do after getting rejected by unis?,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585813310.0,"Hey there! Hope you are all doing well in this whole ongoing situation but am here to seek advice as to what I should be doing after my diploma. I‚Äôve applied for local unis however my gpa is only 3.1. portfolio is really outstanding. No regrets on my poly education cause I‚Äôve done my best despite my own circumstances. 

Recently friends around me have been getting interview invites and seeing that happening to them is hard-warming, but I actually broke down right after cause it hit me that I highly likely won‚Äôt be getting a spot in Uni. 

I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs has things planned out early and this time round it seems like for once I don‚Äôt? Wanted to apply for overseas Uni to do speech and language therapy/ occupational therapy but after going through an overseas internship stint I realised that I get homesick way too easily & wasn‚Äôt a feasible option. 

Current plan is to wait for rejection letters from unis to come in and then I‚Äôll start applying for jobs in the healthcare ( Community care ) or ncss sector and after that I‚Äôll have 2 options of undergrad studies 

1. Nus adult learner programme to do their FASS degree and major in social work 

Pros: 

nus cert would be more reputable as I may want to pursue masters in ntu‚Äôs gerontology 

Cons: 
only accept applicants with 4 years of working experience pertaining to say that I‚Äôll be 25 when I‚Äôm studying then & only getting a degree when I‚Äôm 28/29.

Have to drop work when I‚Äôm studying this cause it‚Äôs a full time programme 

2. Suss part time social work programme 

Pros: 
Part time programme hence I‚Äôll be able to juggle both work and studies 

Cons:
Degree Might not be recognised by ntu for my masters. 

have sources claiming that suss social work grads don‚Äôt get jobs easily 

I‚Äôm particularly interested in the healthcare sector ( nursing ) but there‚Äôs no private degree for me to do cause it‚Äôs all TOP-ups so I‚Äôll have to start from diploma if I want to pursue nursing but I‚Äôm not keen on doing that hence the shift towards social work. 

To seniors who completed poly and went on to work.. was it tough? And did you guys further studies in the end ?

[A Levels] Some common mistakes students make in General Paper Essays (Abridged),Junior Colleges :karma:,1585803099.0,"Hello! 

So, I'm attempting to pay it forward again for JC students. But before we begin, I'd like to emphasise - please, please, please stay safe. Stay at home as much as possible on your e-learning day. Sanitise your hands regularly!

Anyway, this is an abridged version of my blog post on GP essays . These are some of the common mistakes that should be mitigated as much as possible. The thing about GP - as someone who went through this gauntlet - is that these mistakes, no matter how small they may be, can easily add up. Without further ado, let's get into it!

**#1 - Not defining the key terms and setting parameters in a question** 

This is important as doing so will give you a roadmap for your essay, and potentially open up different interpretations. It may also cause you to think in binary terms. (See below)

**#2 - Vague arguments that do not answer the question**

This means writing stuff like ""Yes, indeed, the government is responsible,"" in response to a question like, ""To what extent is the government responsible for individual welfare""? It's not enough to simply give a stand, you need to be more specific w.r.t. *why the government is responsible*.

**#3 - Balance = Thinking in binary terms**

To many students, balance means an argument and a *direct* counter-argument. This isn't balance - *it's contradiction*. To me, balance means being accurate. In short, we can argue for something, say... ""practice is a very effective way to study"" *while pointing out its limitations*. This is still balance.

**#4 - Narrating examples instead of establishing the link** 

This means giving too much detail on the example, instead of explaining how it proves your point. It prevents you from being concise and staying laser-focused. 

**#5 - Disregarding grammar**

This mistake is something that undermines your language score, sure. But the bigger problem is that it prevents a clear expression of your arguments. It's really simple - if the examiners don't understand what you're saying, they can't give credit where it's due. 

So, yeah. These are, to be honest, elementary mistakes - i.e., you shouldn't be making them. But I'm pretty sure we all space out sometimes and lose our awareness of these things. (Trust me... It happens so many times. Even for me, as an adult.) This post is meant to help you stay aware of these mistakes!

Hopefully this helps. If you have any other questions, do PM me, or you can simply head on over to my blog for the 5 common mistakes on GP [essays](https://www.gpspectrum.com/post/5-common-mistakes-in-general-paper-essays)! (Much more details there, including quick solutions to these mistakes.)

"[UNI] Low cGPA (2.77). Currently working, what options do I have regarding further studies?",University :snoo_smile:,1585797679.0,"I graduated from NYP with a Diploma in Nanotechnology and Material Science in 2018. Currently working in quite a good electronics company as a Senior Technician for almost 1.5 years now. Honestly, I don't really like my job but I don't really have a choice.

I have been thinking of furthering my studies but I am not sure what options I have with my pathetic cGPA. I have been trying to apply all the local Uni (NTU, NUS, SUTD and SIT) since 2018 after I graduated but as you can see, I didn't get in.

I mainly applied for Engineering courses as I'm more interested in those courses especially Science related (I really want to learn something that I'm interested in, but I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't be choosing and just apply whatever I can based on my cGPA, if possible, please advise me!!)

Maybe some background:

* What do my parents think?

Luckily, I have a very supportive family and they are fine with all my choices as long as I'm happy. Even so, I still hope I can further my studies with minimal cost so that I will not burden my family too much.

* Do you have a good portfolio?

I have a relatively good portfolio in Poly? I was the Vice-President of my school club which is event-based. I also volunteer in my temple almost every week. And maybe that's it. I think these won't be enough to get into any local uni here.

Are there other options for me regarding further studies, should I change my path? If no options at all, should I consider overseas studies or should I continue working for a few more years? Feel free to be savage (maybe not too much), I really need some advise and directions.

[O Levels] Please don't undermine private tutors in this time of need,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585795098.0,"I'm a private tutor. I run a small tuition centre. After deducting rent, marketing & administrative costs - I take home around $2500 a month. I teach more than 10 classes weekly.

It has been a very demoralising few weeks.

1. Amidst the suspension of centre-based tuition classes - parents have asked for discount on fees. I tried to help whenever I can by waiving off fees or giving discounts, knowing fully that it will be at my own expense.

Yet, I've received a lot of comments from parents who do not have financial difficulties, going ""e-learning should be cheaper"".

e-Learning IS not cheaper than classroom based learning. It has been 2 sleepless weeks with this mad scramble to move classes online. We've had to to spend sessions doing orientation for you and your children to help explain how to do classes online. We had to buy IT equipment, video recording equipment - all of it not cheap with my measly $2500 monthly salary.

You think it's less effort - it's not. It's more effort and more work. And you want to pay us less.

Please don't undermine our efforts by requesting to pay us less. If you have financial difficulties, we will discount for you. But don't say ""e-Learning should be paid less"". Thanks.

Rental still goes on - landlords who don't take the initiative to help and pass on rental rebates, I'm looking at YOU!

2. We totally understand that why we have been closed down. Health comes first - sure.

However, can don't call us non-essential?

School is essential, tuition is non-essential. Minister said that. True facts of life.

But, but. Can you also see this.

In every sector, there are good people and there are bad people.

In the tuition sector, there are some of us good ones and some of us bad ones.

I dare say, I care about each and every-one of my students. I do my best to motivate. I do my best to talk to them when they have family troubles. I come up with extra worksheets when I know they are lagging behind.

In schools, you also have teachers who are not motivated, who only come to school for the paycheck and do the minimum.

If all school teachers are good - need tuition teachers for what?

If everybody scoring A1, A2 and A\* - then no need for tuition. Some parents find tuition because their kids have been failing.

We don't need you to recognise us. But don't call us non-essential can?

3. Common comment from school teachers and from the public - ""They should pay school teachers more"" or ""Tuition teachers make so much money"".

You know how many times I roll my eyes at this?

Straits Times - I'm looking at you. Thanks for always reporting on ""million dollar"" tutors. Now everybody thinks that all tutors make millions.

Reality check - If you are a school teacher and you think you will make a lot of money leaving the public sector, feel free to go try your luck.

Is every school teacher a Principal? or a Cluster Superintendent? or a Director? No right?

Same thing with the private sector ok? The top tutors make a lot of money. The normal tutors like us make close to the 'median' $4600 of the typical Singaporean.

We don't have CPF.

We don't have AWS.

We don't have performance bonus.

In November & December, we eat bread but still pay rent.

Whatever we earn in 10 months, must ration across 12 months, because November & December parents go holiday and don't want tuition.

No - regular tutors don't make millions.

Stop dreaming. Most school teachers are not zai. If they leave the public sector, they will eat grass.

I make $2500 a month - if you feel that is fantastic, you can be my guest. You have a choice. If you think you can make more as a private tutor, take the plunge into the world of the unknown.

4. Teachers got a lot of admin work, not like private tutor only need to teach

We don't have admin work. We have ""admin work"" - marketing, accounting & trying to keep the business alive. We don't only teach.

You have a 'clear thick' line between yourself and parents. We don't. We are obligated to answer, and talk to parents everyday. Do you know there are parents who call us and talk to us everyday about their kids and their anxieties? (a lot of parents from top schools are actually very anxious about their kids) I spend 1 to 2 hours daily talking to 2 to 3 parents everyday.

5. Thank you for classifying us together with KTVs, Bars & Entertainment

I called the bank to lower my credit card interest because in anticipation of school closures, I invested heavily in video recording equipment and IT equipment that I actually cannot pay for with my measly salary.

Guess what the bank said? You are not from an eligible 'adversely affected' sector.

Adversely affected = tourism, aviation, F&B and entertainment.

Entertainment qualifies but private education doesn't qualify.

Again, i understand why we have been shut down. But can everyone remember us private tutors have families to feed too? Mortgages or rent to pay? Bills to pay?

6. We are human beings too

We have feelings. We have empathy. We have tried to help whenever we can. My tuition centre offers free tuition all these years to whomever are on MOE Financial Assistance scheme. When parents face difficulties (retrenched, fell sick), we always cut our fees or give free. When students ask for extra help, we coach and we don't charge extra.

We are trying our best too. Really. We are all in this together.

I don't know since when being a 'private tutor' is a nasty thing.

Maybe tuition centres like Learning Lab, Mavis Tutorial or any of those big tuition centres with big MRT and bus adverts and sprawling land space of more than 10000 square feet might make millions of dollars a year. Maybe they have strong investors with hundreds of millions. But hey that's not us. Don't assume that we have a mountain of profits to stomach this because we don't.

Also, a lot of our kids and a lot of our parents always tell us that school teachers always say bad things about private tutors. ""Tuition is a waste of money"", ""don't need go for tuition"", ""private tutors are not qualified and don't know what they are teaching"".

Some teachers seem to spend a lot of time bad-mouthing private tutors.

Grass always seem to be greener on the other side.

You get your bonuses, your CONNECT plan, your PB and your 13th month. When the economy does well - you get extra money for doing absolutely nothing extra.

2 to 3 year 'old' Teachers pay around $5k to $6k. HOD teachers pay is ""7k to 10k"". VPs more. Ps on Superscale can make $200+ k per year. Stop making comparisons and keep saying private tutors make more.

Just focus on teaching your kids please. You still have a job.

I may not have one when the dust settles.

Also, remember that a lot of us private tutors were once school teachers.

Some of us left because of school mergers.

Some of us left because we were pregnant, had kids and could no longer cope.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with this thing called EPMS.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with all the politics, committees, organising overseas trips and want to just focus on the kids.

I have friends in the gig economy or in the private sector (regularly paid jobs) who have been temporarily laid off. So, we should really engage in constructive dialogue rather than ranting. We can also find ways to adapt, like tightening our belts, or even finding a 2nd job. We work hard to add value to the education landscape - and I firmly believe this pays off in the end, not just for ourselves, but for the younger generation.\n\nStay strong, man.

Though this is true, I have had several encounters of secondary sch teachers and jc teachers who speak badly of tuition teachers, saying that they are ‚Äúnot updated with the syllabus‚Äù, does not know the ‚Äúformat that Cambridge expects‚Äù eg. I mean, its the student‚Äôs choice whether to have tuition or not since we are the ones in charge of our own education.

I believe as a full time tutor youself, you know that for sure too. Justifying the additional costs spent on IT stuff is merely a reason to account for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced, but should not be exacerbated as a veto factor for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced. If online tuition could replace physical tuition/teaching, there wouldn't be a point in having schools right? Moreover with the roll out of HBL/SLS assignments in schools, there is less of an incentive for parents to have their child go for online tuition if teachers in schools right now are doing it also (also helped out in a sch to set up resources for a certain subject too last week, and probably over the course of next few weeks).\n\nJust my two cents worth.

[Rant] Close offices and schools,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585752908.0,"1000 cases. 54 local, 25 unlinked. Yes its incomparable to other countries, but Singapore is small, and very densely populated. With an increase in cases, the hospitals would be unable to take care of these patients as well as before. More people are going to die.

&#x200B;

To restrict all gatherings to less than 10 people and yet still have people go to work/ school is the most hypocritical thing I have heard. We have to be ahead of the virus, not behind it. Keeping offices and schools open when there are other options such as home-based learning is wrong.

&#x200B;

Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease. Children can spread the disease, and also DIE from it. I am sure no parent wants their child to be the first child to die. If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we? They have schools open for only children whom cannot stay at home.

&#x200B;

The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. You wont ever be able to fix your economy if your citizens have died.

Anything? What about the single mother with two children working multiple part time jobs? How is she to help her children have any sense of normalcy if a sudden shutdown were to be imposed? What about the family in a single room HDB that can‚Äôt afford a computer? If everything shuts down how are they to continue studies and keep pace with everyone else? I think many are speaking from a position of privilege and fail to see that this is a very real existential issue for thousands of singaporean households. What about parents who are at the front line of health care? Do they go back to take care of their children and compromise our primary defence against the virus?\n\n>If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nThe UK, as did most of the West, has completely bungled its response to the coronavirus, and was forced to take draconian measures to stop the tidal wave they introduced. Both the US and UK have also had to cancel national exams, throwing millions of students into a state of uncertainty for their future and ambitions. I think it‚Äôd be fairer to compare public health measures with Taiwan and Japan, for instance. \n\n> The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. \n\nI agree that in the long term, public health and the state of the economy aren‚Äôt diametrically opposed. However, it is unfair to compare this to SARS. Look at the US. Relatively unscathed by SARS. For the coronavirus, unemployment claims now stand at more than 3 million, the highest it has been in American history (here‚Äôs a graph as reference: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-3-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week-almost-5-times-the-record-high/) Think about trade-dependent Singapore in that context. Have you gone to the airport recently? Tourism in Singapore is essentially dead. Retail is dead. Disproportionate consequences for the poorest in our society. No rational company will be seeking to employ with these economic conditions. This is projected to be the worst recession in Singapore‚Äôs history. The government has offered unemployment benefits, which it has almost never substantially done in its decades of rule. As the US, Malaysia, China falter, a second wave of economic crisis for us. This is a far more severe economic problem. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs a game of costs and benefits, and the fact of the matter is that the situation is more nuanced than most would likely hope it to be. No perfection to be found on earth. I took a look at your post history and you‚Äôve asked a similar question 2 weeks ago, and commenters there have given very valid points you should have considered"", 'I will just explain why the economy being bad is DIRE. \n\nassuming schools are close, our economy worsens.  this will result in retrenchment. \nand hence, those working in retail,  your taxi uncle or even your waiter will have no job. \n\nwhat will happen to their family? \nthey will have limited savings,  and they have to compete with others to buy for necessities to cope with covid. prices of stuff like toilet paper and staple food HAS risen. and it will continue to rise if economy worsens.  and Singaporeans will panic buy and with their limited savings, they can only buy a few. and i think they will die faster before covid hits them. #hardtruths\n\nwhat will happen to all of us? some of us may not even be retrenched.\n\nbecause we have an increased in the number of needies (you mention theres other way to help them without schools right),govt has to pull more money to help them. they have to spend on 1) delivering the items to them 2)finding out who they are (who got retrenched recently, who is below the poverty line...) 3) spending money to help them get over this tough time\n\nand since money doesnt fall from the sky, this means LESSER funds to go into healthcare. Lesser masks, lesser funds to buy more covid-19 swab, lesser funds to operate the hospital and many more.. \nwhat will that mean?  MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.  MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE CURED.  THIS WILL GET OUR OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE LOGISTICS.  OH NO', 'Many ministers and country leaders have said that Covid-19 may drag on longer than expected, even until next year, so do you suggest that we close schools and offices till next year as well? Many schools taking IB are already affected with the cancellation(?) of their exams which could affect their university applications. Are we just going to pause everything we‚Äôre doing till 2020 is over and pretend that nothing has happened?\n\nIMO, with how open Singapore is, there‚Äôs always going to be new cases like how we‚Äôll have to face many waves of cases (eg. China, UK/US), so there‚Äôs not really a way to stop the number to 0 unless you want to stop visitors from coming in and cause our already-slowing tourism industry will continue to dry out.\n\n‚ÄúThe economy will not collapse‚Äù How are you so sure? I actually believe that this is only the start (of Covid-19 and also of the effects on our economy) and many times, the effects will actually continue to spill over even when the outbreak is controlled. If you didn‚Äôt know, Singapore‚Äôs economy already started slowing down in 2019 and there were hints of a possible recession in end-2019 even without Covid-19. Latest release by MAS showed current projection is about -1 to -4% in GDP, drop from the initial projection of -0.5 to -1%, that‚Äôs about 4x. If the schools and offices were to close, the contraction will be even larger and companies may end up forcing their employees to take unpaid leaves if Covid-19 continues.\n\nWhile there may be all the different packages pushed out by the Govt to support all the employers and employees, money doesn‚Äôt drop from the sky. You can‚Äôt expect to keep pulling out money without putting money in, can you? There is a limit to the amount we have in our reserves and we shouldn‚Äôt take them for granted.\n\nMaybe what you can do now is to practice good hygiene and good money habits.', "">If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nplease look at the UK.  is the UK doing anything better than us? \n\n>The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine.\n\nhow naive of you to think that the SARS is comparable to COVID? the SARS is afraid of the heat,  COVID is not.  COVID would not.  SARS lasted for five months and this is already the fifth month of COVID and it isnt getting any better\n\nThe ECONOMY will collapse. Yes we are fine now from the consequences of SARS,  but repercussions are terrible if we completely ignore them after it.  If we have not reach that stage yet,  let's not close them down.

I've talked to my siblings about this and they told me to stay in jc for the time being.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>So I'm planning to do that but I feel like I'm just going to dread jc more and more to the point where I hate it. I'm also one of the few people from my secondary school that came to that jc and I still haven't found friends that I can relate to. I think the problem is because most of them are from elite schools and there's just this gap between elite schools students and neigubourhood school students. I'm not saying all elite school students are bad or they are like this but generally that's what it feels like? It's just so hard for me to fit in. And after hearing what my friend from another jc said, a neighbourhood jc would have suited me much better in terms of the culture so I'm also regretting my choice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I really dislike the general culture and environment in my jc. It's not that it's bad, it's just not suitable for me. Honestly I just regret my whole existence?? Like I just feel like I'm born in the wrong country at the wrong time. And I honestly don't mind dropping out of school and work some odd jobs like retail especially since I have nothing I want to do in life anyway. I feel like I would be happier that way too but given my family's situation, I can't do that because it's not going to earn me much money. I'm just feeling so lost, unmotivated and shitty in life right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Am I the only one feeling this way? My only hope is that by the end of this year I can maybe figure out what I want to do in future otherwise I'm really screwed for life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHey /u/hihiheyheyhi, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

As baseline reference, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, UChicago have around a 5% acceptance rate. Duke, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins around 8%. NYU, Cornell, Tufts around 10-15%. Consider that applicants to these schools are self-selecting, i.e that the acceptance rate is in the context of a immensely talented application pool. Recommend you check which individual schools you want to apply, they release admission rate statistics every year. If you apply for financial aid to need-aware schools, it becomes very, very hard to get in. As an Asian international from an overrepresented country (I assume SG), your application also becomes less competitive. International students make up a relatively small percentage of most US undergraduate college populations as a result.

Firstly, kudos for surviving JC till now! It\'s not an easy fight, but will be fulfilling in the end.\n\nI was in JC in 2013 and 2014 (and got into NUS FASS in 2015). My first year was fine, but second year was HORRENDOUS. In the beginning of the year, I topped the cohort in my Geog test, but my Physical Geog teacher (who was also my Form Teacher) mocked me in front of my class saying ""You spot topic one right? Thats why you scored so well"". That de-motivated me A LOT and I started scoring badly for Geog. (Like shouldn\'t a teacher be encouraging instead of mocking their students like that?) I also started feeling really de-motivated about studying other subjects in general (I am a person who gets affected easily by what other people say of me). Though I did not score Us, but it was still a failing grade. I scored pretty badly for my tests and prelim, IIRC I scored 40+ or 50+ RP...\n\nHowever, knowing that I have a goal in mind (which is, to enter a Local Uni), I knew that I can\'t continue to fail and waste 2 years of my education. So, I started to look for my teachers (for Math and Econs), and started reading more notes and doing more TYS, When I say look for my teachers, I literally signed myself up for every single ""remedial"" ""tutorial"" classes possible so that I can do more practices and be able to clear my doubts almost immediately if any. Night study was useful too because there would be many students studying together and the atmosphere would be good for studying.\n\nIn the end,  I miraculously scored 75 for A-Levels. Not as excellent, but I\'m satisfied.

[Scholarships] General Scholarship Interview Board Advice,Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585727685.0,"As the title says. I don't cover the other aspects of scholarship selection process (too many). I assume it is an individual interview board (1 interviewee to many interviewers). My examples are heavily skewed towards scholarships offered by the civil service, but the general principles still apply to private organisations. Can also be useful for general university admission interviews too. Here goes:

&#x200B;

1. Know the scholarship organisation.

Don't go for the interview thinking that CAAS manages healthcare, or that LTA is under MSF. Go to the organisation's website and scrutinise the ""about us"" section, as well as resources on their policies. Summarise it into an easy-to-remember 5W1H about the organisation. Know what the organisation's mission and aims are, as they can be the core to your responses for difficult questions. For example, MINDEF's mission is to ""enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy"". So, if they ask you questions regarding (for example) countries who may be aggressive to us and how we may defend ourselves against them, your answer is literally there. The baseline is deterrence and diplomacy - how do you go about doing that? You just need to build on that foundation and flesh out your thoughts. Know what your organisation stands for, and be creative and flexible within that framework. Of course, this is not saying that you cannot give answers based on alternative foundations. Continuing from the above example, I may think that instead of deterrence and diplomacy, throwing money at the problem works too. However, you will need to have a damned good reason for holding that belief, and you will have to justify it on very solid grounds if you want to go that way. The most extraordinary individuals will have opinions like these.

&#x200B;

2. Be *very* familiar with the issues facing your organisation now, and in the future.

Your scholarship organisation is not looking to give you money for free. You are an investment to them, and you need to show that their investment in you will not be wasted. This means that you need to demonstrate an awareness of problems and policies, so that you can be a future leader in the organisation. I cannot stress this enough. This means you must know the following:

a. What are the problems facing this organisation now, or the problems that this organisation is looking to address?

b. What are the current solutions/policies that are in place, and their limitations?

c. What are the future/foreseeable/potential problems that this organisation will face in the future?

Parts A and B are easy. Just read the organisation's webpage, newspaper articles and other reference materials. You might need to reverse engineer policies to figure out what problem they are addressing, but those are relatively straightforward.

Part C is the most difficult. You need to read up extensively for this. Usually, policymakers will allude to problems that we will face down the road in newspaper articles or parliamentary debates. You can also have your own ideas on the potential problems that may be faced, but make sure its logical. For example, if you're going to be interviewed at MND, land use and availability is going to be a huge concern down the road (it already is now, but it'll only get worse). So, if we need more space to build, what could we do about it? We can either build further upward, or we can go underground. Or we can get more land. Dump more sand into the sea? Create more land between Tekong and the mainland? Turn Singapore's 63 islands into one huge landmass? Annex part of Malaysia? What are the pros and cons of each? Why is one solution perhaps preferred over another, in your opinion? These are the trains of thought that you will need to possess. Again, problem solving and policymaking is a key aspect of your future career, and you can bet that they will test you on this.

&#x200B;

3. Have your own opinion/stance.

What this means is, if the MFA interviewer decides to ask you whether we should support the US or China *in times of conflict*, it is probably not a good idea to say ""I think we should support both/neither"". Even though in practice, yes, we do exactly that during peacetime, the context of the question is forcing you to choose a stance. I am doubtful that they would ask the question minus ""in times of conflict"", because the standard answer during peacetime is very clear, and there's really no need to ask giveaway questions. They want to test your analytical skills, awareness of Singapore's interests, and ability to make a judgement call. You do not want to come across as someone who cannot decide, or makes bad (read: unjustifiable) decisions. Remember, you are being assessed at being a policymaker. You cannot make policy if you can't decide. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions based on your answers too. In addition, after you've committed yourself to a stance, stick to it unless you realise you've made a huge mistake. For example, if you say we should support the US because it's rules based yada yada, then don't give an answer later on that seems to suggest the opposite (eg we should support Russia because Putin is a great guy). However, if you realise you've truly f\*cked up based on the line of questioning you're getting (""why do you say Venezuela is similar to Singapore in terms of corruption?""), then you should withdraw what you've said and accept the new information given to you. It can either come across as you being open minded, or you having said something badly mistaken, depending on what you just said. Which brings me to...

&#x200B;

4. Don't smoke your way in interviews.

The panel of interviewers are career professionals. They know exactly what they are talking about. They likely know that you're trying to bluff them, and depending on how serious they are, they can question you repeatedly until it becomes clear to everyone involved that you're smoking, in which case you're done for. Don't let yourself get into this position - point 2 is key. If they ask you something that you really cannot answer, be upfront about it - I'm sorry but I am not familiar with this topic. Could you give me a background or could we discuss a different topic? If you do this once, it's probably acceptable. If you do this too many times, it means you don't know much about the organisation. Give reasonable and logical answers.

&#x200B;

5. Miscellaneous interview things

First impressions count. Even though interviews are likely to be virtual now, it's not excuse for skimping on the basics. Which means, be early. Not on time. *Early*. Dress appropriately and well. Confidence (but not braggadocio) when the interview starts. Sit up straight. Smile. Hands either clasped on the table or on your lap. No fidgeting. Minimise ums and ahs. You can see yourself on the computer screen now, use it to your advantage in addressing the above. Thank the interviewers for their time at the end. Convey a sense of gratitude that you are called for the interview. Don't be that d\*bag that treats scholarships as a god-given right to you.

When the interviewers ask you to describe yourself, give an elevator pitch (meaning 30 seconds to 1 minute, tops). Who are you, why do you want the scholarship and why you are a good fit for the organisation and vice versa. No one on the board is interested in listening to how you love trains for 5 minutes if you are interviewing at MOH. I wouldn't go so far as to say avoid saying irrelevant things about yourself, but everything you say in this pitch should have a purpose. If you really want to talk about how you have a piano diploma, it should have some link or relevance to the scholarship, else you might as well not mention it.

For personality/character questions, you should prepare for them beforehand. What are your strengths and weaknesses, most inspiring person in your life, a time when you failed and how you recovered, that kinda thing. These are easy to think about, reflect who you are as a person and you should have some idea of how you might answer these questions before the interview.

There are also some interview questions that are... interesting. I've heard of interview questions like ""if you were a tree, what would you feel?"". I have no good answer for how to answer these questions. I get the feeling that these questions are a conduit for you to express your personality/thoughts in a de-personalised way, but imo there are much better ways to ask these questions. If you get them, don't panic and don't make a fool of yourself.

You should also come across as being enthusiastic about the organisation, or at least genuinely interested in it. That can mean having a passion for the job. For example, if you're going for a teaching scholarship, how do you know that it is for you? Maybe you've taught tuition before and really enjoyed the process of giving knowledge to others. That kinda thing. But don't overdo or fake it. It's really obvious when people are doing that.

Usually, the interviewers will ask you if you have questions. It would be good to have one or two. They must not be dumb questions (""where is the headquarters of this organisation? Who's the boss? Do I get lunch breaks?""). They can be questions like, ""what is the best thing about working here? what can I look forward to as a scholar here?"" Convey a sense of curiosity and anticipation (and maybe commitment) to the organisation. It's your last chance to make a good impression.

&#x200B;

Lastly, remember that scholarships are not the end of your journey. If you get it, it's just the beginning. Don't take it for granted that you will get it, and if you do get it, treasure it and don't regret it. I'll hang around the thread to answer questions here and there, if there are any. PMs are welcome too. I'm open to opinions for improvement/criticism of this post too.

I have a few choices:

1) Specialist Diploma: downside is that the intake is every year June and July so i can only get in, the following year due to my ORD date. I would have to wait another year for the next intake. However, i emailed them and they say its possible to exempt some modules if i happen to get into a degree, example SUSS's biomedical engineering

2) Specialist Diploma choice 2: October intake, but might not have exemptions as it is not tied to SUSS‚Äôs modules. (NYP‚Äôs biomedical and pharmaceutical specialist diploma). Would it be worth it? 

2) Just apply for SUSS part time biomedical engineering. Although i prefer studying full time, i think since i cant get in to any of the local uni, this is my best bet.

Does specialist diploma let you have a higher chance of entering a local uni, full time? Is the specialist diploma worth your time?

[UNI] AUS/US/UK Medical Schools,University :snoo_smile:,1585703441.0,"Hey! Can anyone who has decided/ got accepted to overseas medical schools please share your experience  (such as tests u took etc.) And most importantly, how are you planning to afford it? (What are good loans to take, or bursaries/scholarships available?)

(Context: overseas unis are soooo expensive, my fanily is not well off so I will have to handle the fees myself. Got rejected to do local med :/ but not ready to give up the dream!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fsplxn/uni_aususuk_medical_schools/,12,"[""Not studying overseas but perhaps giving my two cents to help you set some expectation straights. Bursary & Scholarships are almost impossible to get for overseas medical education (less President Scholarship) I helped you look into A\\* Scholarship as well but it's also only for local medical studies. Fundamentally, a scholar would have to return to the sponsoring organisation to serve out his/her bonds, but there's no incentives for organisation to sponsor your medical studies because you would have to serve in the hospitals. Also, local universities are producing sufficient doctor for the near future so even less incentives. Your best bet would be to go overseas and study and pay out of your own pocket and hope to apply for MOHH Pre Employment Grant. Again to set out some expectations here, PEG are increasingly harder and harder to get as well ([http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application](http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application)) It guarantees you a job back in Singapore upon graduation so win-win I would say. \n\nPrepare to set aside about half a million for tuition + living accommodation if you are set on going down this path. Yes, as a doctor you would definitely be able to afford it *EVENTUALLY.* But note that a HO is paid $3650 gross basic, and MO is paid $4500 + $500 basic. If you include calls and stuff maybe add in \\~$400? An associate consultant is paid around $9000-$10000 but that's provided you made it through residency and you would be about early 30s by then. So math it out roughly on your possible loan repayment plans. Again to set expectations, not everyone would gain a residency spot and a lot ended up as chronic MO and leave the service after 5 years to private practice. But on a brighter side, locum pays about $100/hr and a GP working in a chain get paid about $15k. So actually if you would want to skip all the hospital work, you can go overseas study, do part of your training overseas and return to Singapore to work and earn the sweet and comfy $15k, should be able to pay off your debt fairly quickly if you are smart with your money.\n\nAlternatively you can try for Duke NUS through train programmes with some of the universities or look into other healthcare degrees then pursue Duke NUS again if you are sure this is for you."", 'Are you planning to try local med again?', 'How‚Äôs your BMAT?', 'How are your extracurriculars like? Are they excellent? If you do not mind taking a gap year to do volunteer work and work on your ECs I think that you will stand a higher chance next year if you try again! Especially if you go for internships and such, but it‚Äôll be kind of tough to look for one now considering the COVID-19 situation.\n\nUS Medical Schools are out of the question as they are all Postgrad and you would have to do an Undergrad degree in the US/CANADA/UK first. They are also extremely competitive and to get into the top few you have to have an extremely attractive portfolio as an Undergrad. Since you said that you‚Äôd have to handle the fees yourself I won‚Äôt advice this option!\n\nFor UK generally they do accept A-Level students as long as you achieve a good BMAT/UKCAT score. I‚Äôm not that sure about scholarships though. They do offer scholarships to international students for sure, but that may vary from University to University so you‚Äôd have to do in-depth research! Email them and ask about their scholarships.\n\nI think AUS is one of the most suitable options for you. Their currency is similar to that of Singapore‚Äôs and AUS is also closer to Singapore (in fact poorer now if I‚Äôm not wrong). Their cost of living and tuition fees in general are less costly compared to the UK. You can try Monash. Monash‚Äôs extremely popular for Singaporeans, but you‚Äôd have to take the ISAT. Monash‚Äôs medical program is only 5 years long too so tuition would be more affordable. University of Adelaide costs $500,000 for their 6 year Undergrad medicine. Monash would be a better option if you do intend to head to AUS!\n\nI‚Äôm personally a Polytechnic student. Graduated last year from SP with the Diploma in Biomedical Science and am currently serving my NS. My GPA‚Äôs (3.5) definitely not high enough for local Medical Schools (especially NUS). I honestly don‚Äôt believe in the fact that NUS uses entirely holistic admissions. Ultimately GPA/RP plays a huge role in their decisions. I‚Äôm opting for Postgraduate Medicine which is something you can do as well. It‚Äôll definitely take a longer time - 8 years in total instead of 5 to 6 years, but if you really want to do Medicine I think you should just go for it if nothing else works out. \n\nYou could do a BSc in Life Sciences/Biomedical Sciences/Biological Sciences at NTU/NUS then pursue a MD at Duke-NUS. I think that doctors who attain their Medical degrees at the Postgrad level can make extremely good doctors too, especially with the amount of exposure they can get during their Undergrad years that can make them even more mature. \n\nI‚Äôm personally going to do a BSc in Yale-NUS (waitlisted though) or in the UK/AUS before doing Postgrad Med.

NEW Scholarship Interview [SCHOLARSHIP],Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585684227.0,"This is just a record of what I went through during the NEW scholarship interview recently. I have been trying to find information on this particular scholarship on Reddit but have failed to do so. I hope this post would give future scholarship applicants insight into how the interview works and what can you expect in the interview. I applied for this scholarship in hopes of getting the NEA scholarship so that I would at least have a job after studying environmental studies/ earth sciences in uni since the employment rate and job prospects in general for this area of study is relatively poor. Due to the COVID-19 situation, the interview was also held on a zoom call but I would assume that it is similar to the offline experience. The interview started at around 0830 and there was some orientation ( for us it was the features of a zoom call, but it could be familiarisation of the offline place instead) for about 30 mins. We then proceeded onto our first activity which was held at a group level, with a total number of 8 participants for each interview time slot. This was a case study and us having to come up with solutions to the problem in the case study and presenting our points to the assessors and admin staff. I think the key idea here is to lead the discussion and not be led since there are always assessors watching you, even if you are not aware of it. The first activity was rather simple, with many heads contributing ideas, it wasn't hard for us to reach a satisfactory answer at the end of 20 mins. We then had a 5 min break.

The next activity was done at a smaller group level ( the interviewees being split into 2 separate teams ). Here, we were presented with a case study and we had to engage in discussions to support our give topic sentence. We had to debate with the other team and argue for our case ( think of it as an essay where you are discussing the for and they are discussing the against). Once again, it is important to show initiative as the assessors will not know you have good ideas until you voice them out. Do not be shy since everyone is probably as nervous as you are. During this activity, stay on topic and not just ramble on and on about what you have learnt in school, this caused a lot of time to be wasted during my discussion period as 1 of the candidates vomited out what he had learnt in school, without any thought of the question ahead. The debate part was fun, and once again do not be afraid to speak up as you might be seen as lacklustre due to your lack of motivation and participation. There was a 5 min break after this.

The last activity was an individual presentation where we had to come up with a solution to tackle the problem while taking many other factors into consideration. This was quite stressful as you were alone and will only be given 20 min to prepare a word document or PowerPoint slide for the presentation. The presentation includes 3 mins of presentation time and 2 mins of Q&A session. This can be quite fun if you have unique ideas that you think will catch the assessors' eyes. Don't forget to speed through the presentation as you probably will not have enough time to present all that you have prepared. Be ready to think on the spot as the assessors will throw you questions regarding your presentation, and some of the questions can be a curveball that could ruin your otherwise perfect interview.TLDR: the interview was fun and just have fun. I believe that if you have what it takes, you will strive no matter what conditions you are placed under.I hope this post will give you information and further insight into the NEW scholarship interview.

Say u have C2H6O, u can draw it as ethanol or CH3-O-CH3. Basically means that u shift O in between the carbons. Can‚Äôt really put this one in words soz :‚Äô)\n\nNext, positional isomers!

Take butene for example, now there are 2 ways to draw it, which is the double bond between carbon 1 and 2, and another way is between carbon 2 and 3. \n\nLast, chain isomers! It‚Äôs really just branching out the straight chain. Let‚Äôs use but-1-ene (double bond between carbon 1 and 2) so the only way u can branch it out is 3 carbons in a straight line and one carbon branched out and u get 2 chain isomers (including the original, the 4 carbon straight chain)! \n\nI use this method for JC chem so tbh i think the first step isn‚Äôt really that impt for sec sch but yeah!

If I may add a suggestion, it's probably more useful to flip the chain and position steps.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve identify the carbon backbone, all you need to do thereafter is to permute the position of the functional group.\n\nI think that‚Äôs easier than to rearrange the C-skeleton without affecting the position of the FG. You're also less likely to get repeated structures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing pentanol as an example (I‚Äôll be skipping the functional group isomerism):\n\n3 possible chains: pentane, 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylpropane.\n\nA permutation of the possible positions results in the [following 8 isomers](https://imgur.com/a/tWQhGxr).""]","[1585668444.0, 1585700757.0]","[8, 2]"

"[uni] applications: many concerns, a little regret?",University :snoo_smile:,1585645586.0,"soooo 

after a level results came out (i scored 73.75rp, arts stream in jc), i basically thought i had all the time in the world and didnt think much about uni applications... until the last week. didnt think about so much then bc i was quite happy with my grades until i realised (recently) that many many many people did so much better and i'm just one out of the many candidates. 

i submitted my application to 4 universities (big 3 + SUSS) at 11pm plus on 19 march, and looking back, idk if i made the right choice in terms of putting my choices. my application to the university had all the personal statement + essays for ABA/DA. all of cut offs listed below are the 10th percentile of the courses. 

NUS 
1) FASS (cut off 75)
2) project facilities / real estate (cut off both 71.25) 

SMU 
1) social science, PPS then PLE (cut off 73.75)
2) info systems (cut off 73.75) 

NTU
1) public policy and global affairs (cut off 75rp) 
2) sociology (cut off 72.5)
3) philosophy (cut off 70) 

SUSS 
1) public safety and security
2) social work with minor 

i see people getting offers left and right, and so far i've been contacted by SMU for an interview, and i dont think i did well for it. lowkey stressed now bc i'm afraid i'm not good enough to get to FASS in NUS, and that NTU will take extremely long to contact me given that i'm below their 10th percentile for my first choice, and idk how their offering system works for second choices. my friends who put PPS for SUSS have already gotten emails saying that they were rejected for PPS and they'll be interviewed for their second choice, but i havent heard anything. (friend's rp is 65 onwards). told my other friends about it and they were like ""aiya you apply SUSS when you got chance of going to the big 3, they confirm wont get back to you cause they think you'll reject them what"". 

so now, i'm just lost, anxious, concerned. i'm hoping for some truthful and genuine advice here, and not just ""i'm sure you'll get somewhere eventually dont fret about it xx"" (although thank u for the encouragement!)

[Uni] [SIT Physio] Summary of Kira Interview,University :snoo_smile:,1585628138.0,"Hi everyone, I'm applying for SIT Physiotherapy, and just completed the video interview. Want to share a few things as I've seen people asking about it.

1. I only got 2 practice questions. I thought that they would randomly pick 2 from a pool and change everytime i refresh, but nope, only those 2 practice questions.

2. They say that there are 18 questions, but a few questions just provide the background for upcoming questions, so overall its less.

3. There is a 30min essay component!!! I did not expect this and was not prepared for this...

4. The questions at the start gave u a TOUGH situation and asked how u will react to this situation, what u feel etc.

5. In the middle there are 2 roleplay sessions. The roleplay basically gives you the background brief, and then shows a video of a person roleplaying(for me he was acting like an elderly citizen complaining to me abt an issue). You have to stay in character to your role and try to reply to him, and then in a next video they will ask you on your thoughts abt the situation. As a physio applicant, I mainly got more social services-type questions.

6. The questions at the end of the interview ask the generic questions, e.g. what are your strengths and weakness, why should we pick you, etc.

7. Some ppl have said there was a 2min time for u to write more things at the end, mine wasnt written but was a video for u to say anything for qn 18.

8. Generally the questions gave you 10 seconds to prepare your response, and then 2 mins for your reply.

9. I completed the entire thing in 1h15min.

10. They also ask you on why you picked your specific course vs other healthcare roles offered by SIT.

[Uni] Med school from SUSS ?,University :snoo_smile:,1585609168.0,"was curious cus i saw this guys story on insta . he said he was going to med school but he posted up a letter of offer from suss part time under grad course while also claiming that he is also going to medical school so i was confused ?? 

i went to clarify with my friend‚Äôs lecturers (he‚Äôs in NUS YLL and two of his lecturers teach in Duke-NUS) and they said maybe what he meant was , he actually intended to apply for Duke-NUS or post-grad medical school after his undergrad . but they said that the chances of him even getting into these schools are very low to nil because:

1) they don‚Äôt traditionally accept students from part time undergrad courses
2) they have never accepted students from SUSS which can be seen [here](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/images/default-source/admissions/class-profile---universities.jpg?sfvrsn=8389ccec_0) 
3) the MCAT (entrance exam to Duke-NUS) is notoriously hard and SUSS does not prep you enough for it even if you self study 

is this true ?? can someone pls help me with this , because i am genuinely concerned . because i am now considering on taking a part time undergrad course at SUSS to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor too ??",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fs1b5p/uni_med_school_from_suss/,11,"[""he's lying through his teeth. duke-nus only has programmes with smu, sutd, ntu and nus (and yale-nus). Also, they're pre-MD programmes, not MD ones. and common sense tells us that anyone whose grades are good enough for med sku would not even consider SUSS, let alone a part-time programme there. there also isn't any time for simultaneous studies.\n\nfor your case, i understand your concern. there are many people here who have had the dream to become a doctor created in them either by nature or nurture. some succeed, some don't. for you, unfortunately, all the facts are going against you. i'd just like to add on that even full-time SUSS degrees have nowhere close to the rigour of other big unis in Singapore. Part-time courses have even less. \n\nYes, you may be able to do all the non-medical jobs that the MD folks did before joining the course, and yes, your work experience can be advantageous in the selection process. But above all, medicine is a very textbook-heavy course (at least at the start) and your academic standing has to be top tier to be able to handle the massive amounts of content that the course has. There's a reason why SUSS is called the uni of Self Study. The rigour just isn't there.\n\nI apologize if I sounded rude, but that's the truth I gathered from asking med sku department heads (overseas) and medical lecturers locally. No school is going to risk wasting public/donor funds on someone who has not proven his academic abilities. If you have money, maybe you could go an overseas uni, do a foundation year (and do well) and study MBBS there. Saves you time but will probably cost you half a million in total.

Should I go ahead and declare it at the screening, at the risk of being deemed disingenuous by the university? **Will my offer be revoked?**

Will it be better if I just never declare anything if I originally didn't, and count on never having a noticeable relapse during uni, so that there's no inconsistency between the application and health declaration form?

[uni] uk uni advice?,University :snoo_smile:,1585557216.0,"hello seniors who are now studying in uk/about to study there! i have a few questions abt the application process and i would love to hear several opinions as well!


so basically i'm a J2 in the arts stream taking H2 ELL, History, Lit, and H1 Math. I'm currently doing quite well in all my subjects. I have no H3 bcs I was quite busy w CCA (lol) so i didnt want to risk abandoning my commitments + possibly impacting my H2 negatively. I want to pursue Linguistics/related fields in the UK (another reason why I didn't want to take H3 as theres no H3 ELL). 

1. When did yall start the application process? I'm not from a 'top' JCs and not many (if any) Universities representatives visit my JC so I am lacking in the insights needed for the application process.

2. Is it realistic to aim for 'top' universities like UCL, Edinburgh w only 3 H2s? I realise not taking H3 and 4H2s are impacting my application quite negatively alr, although these Unis don't require 4H2s. I didn't want to take H2 maths as my maths background isn't so strong and I didn't want it to take a toll on my other H2s.

3. Do you think its worth the costs? Singaporean unis aren't so well known for their Humanities courses so I was wondering whether its worth the splurge to study Humanities in the UK.

Insights much appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/frn1ww/uni_uk_uni_advice/,3,"['Hello! Hope my answers help :)\n\n1. I started in dec because application deadlines are usually in early Jan. Unless you‚Äôre applying for Oxbridge, their deadlines are earlier. However I would say start as soon as you can! You need to prep a personal statement as to why you want to study that course and why you chose the UK. You‚Äôll also need a reference from your teacher so it‚Äôs best to give them time to write it.\n\n2. Can‚Äôt answers cause I was from poly :(\n\n3. Doing a humanities course (art hist) overseas and I think it‚Äôs worth it! Looking at related art hist modules offered at NUS/NTU, I like the ones offered at my uni more. I think there‚Äôs more variety and the topics are more interesting. The exposure to the art culture in London  also helps with my course. Additionally, my profs are really high up in their field and have several connections in the industry, allowing us to go behind the scenes of several museums. But I think it‚Äôs most important to look at the modules of the course you plan to do and see if you‚Äôre interested in them/think you‚Äôll enjoy it. No point going overseas if you‚Äôre not gonna like the modules imo.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel feel to PM :)', 'Hi! A fellow artstream student as well who applied to UK unis ~ \nYour school might have done a briefing on UK unis so they do put in place internal deadlines for applications. Generally for oxbridge you definitely have to apply early such as maybe even before Prelims. You can ask your school if you are allowed to apply later if you wish to spend the time focusing on A levels as the deadline for UCAS for most unis is if Im not wrong, January 15. Just always update your teachers as their referrals are important and you would need their help crafting your personal statement.\nYour CCAs and other external activities are definitely impt in your application so dont be discouraged you only take 3 H2s , my friend got accepted into the in UCL and the history course of Edinburgh and she only took 3H2s. \n\nAlso, whether it is worth it honestly depends on your own self. Sg unis are good enough, truly and thats what made me decide to stay here in Sg in the end. Sg unis have many scholarships to help lighten the load. For now, try to search up scholarships that you could potentially apply for to help lighten the financial burden of studying in the UK ! Studying abroad is definitely a wonderful experience but you‚Äôd want to be practical and confirm if your parents are onboard etc', 'Hi! I got offered for UCL (amongst other schools) for linguistics! It‚Äôs very exciting to see another linguistics student-to-be :-) The other answers give good general advice so mine‚Äôs more specific to linguistics.\n\n1. I think sufficiently answered by all the other comments!\n\n2. Since universities like UCL and Edinburgh will only need 3H2s to assess their conditional offer you should be fine with 3H2s! The downside is that you need to score well in all of your H2s and don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù H2 to swap out. In fact I think linguistics isn‚Äôt that competitive a course because all my linguistics conditional offers were AAB, so as long as your UCAS statement is reasonable and you have a good teacher reference I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so competitive that they‚Äôd disadvantage you for being 3H2. The UK schools really don‚Äôt look at your extracurriculars at all, so it‚Äôs a bit strange that the other comments said so. If anything, CCAs only matter for US applications. \n\n3. Look at the courses and specialisation you want in linguistics carefully, and match the schools based on it! I personally didn‚Äôt apply to Oxbridge because (from what I understand on the website) they are very anglocentric and theoretical in their type of linguistic focus (and Oxford doesn‚Äôt even offer it on its own because its combined with Philosophy and Psychology), whereas I wanted to do more applied and quantitative linguistics (computational, experimental, etc) especially in East Asian languages. For this UCL has an Experimental Linguistics course so it suited me perfectly. Locally NTU was a better choice for me because their LMS course covers a wider range of languages and leans towards applied fields, whereas NUS‚Äô only focuses on English linguistics. Edinburgh is a top school for linguistics but it is a straight 4 year MA Linguistics course, so I didn‚Äôt apply for it because I would hope to do an MA in another country.\n\nSo between studying here and overseas, maybe if your specialisation is something that can only be pursued overseas that gives you an easier answer. For instance if you‚Äôre into corpus linguistics Edinburgh has a whole research lab on it while NTU only has one module. There‚Äôs also a question of faculty‚Äîmaybe there‚Äôs a prof at UCL who does research in the area you‚Äôre interested in, but no such profs at NTU. That‚Äôs very important because your profs determine the kind of niche classes you can be exposed to and the kind of undergrad research you can do. For instance I‚Äôm very interested in sign language linguistics and UCL has one faculty with it as their specific research area, and they also have one faculty from Japan who could be a great advisor if I want to do a thesis in East Asian/Japanese languages.\n\nAlso of course, the general appeal of living overseas and learning independence, as the other comments have mentioned.', ""1. I think most schools have powerpoint slides on their website with the timeline for US/UK applications that are available to the public. For oxbridge the deadline is sep/oct for the rest is jan\n2. Yea go for it, as you said 4H2s is not a requirement. You can make up for it with extracurriculars.\n3. I hope so. It's probably best to get some kind of scholarship if it's a stretch to afford it, but even if I don't get one I think I'll still go. Just live on bread and water lol.""]","[1585578916.0, 1585580829.0, 1585616932.0, 1585581916.0]","[3, 2, 2, 1]"

There were 3 questions for mine and a single A4 paper page limit. You can choose to answer any of the 1 out of 3 questions provided. The main aim we discerned after getting into SIT was that they mainly just wanna look at your ability to critically think and reason, which is extremely important to develop going into the healthcare industry. \n\nNot sure if this is still here since its online now...\n\nSecondly, this is the Multiple Mini Interviews(MMI) there were 4 stations for mine \n\nEach station you are given 2 minutes to read through a prep sheet and then you are given 8 minutes to speak. HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU SPEAK FOR ALL 8 MINUTES.\n\nFrom my experience, the following were the general questions they asked for each station(its been awhile so i cant really remember but ill try) \n\n1. General healthcare : they asked about how you think technology has helped the healthcare industry and about medisave/shield. \n\nMy advice: Read up about the basic healthcare system and how it works in singapore.Understand the general principles of the different schemes that the govt has set up for citizens. \n\n2. A critical thinking scenario : a story was given to me about being a patient and encountering a doctor that smelt like alcohol whilst talking to him. They want to know what would you do if you encounter difficulty in the field. \n\nMy advice: Go back to basics on your fundamental morals. Know your right from wrong and the gray in between. Empathise always. \n\n3. Course specific interview: They gonna ask u about the course you applied for. \n\nMy advice: know what an RT does. Know the main purpose of our job( ans: pain relief) and tell them why u want it so bad. \n\n4. Healthcare related: They asked about how the healthcare system works. Like the flow\n\nMy advice: know how people get from the doctor to the hospital and what happens after they get discharged. Like the entire process. \n\nFinal thoughts : tbh i didnt expect to get in and its been a whirlwind of fun and craziness and insanity. But i love it lol. Please think this through if u wanna enter this course because it is very very niche. And youll end up working in the field for a while if you choose to stay. As a year 3, I feel about half my class is ready to leave the industry as soon as we graduate. Its mostly a mixture of jadedness and burnout and lack of motivation.

[Post-Exams][University] Is it still possible to find constant friends in uni?,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585491182.0,"so i just finished a levels last year and though i had a clique and a bunch of close friends who got me through my jc life, it‚Äôs still quite sad to say that i wouldn‚Äôt call them my constants... it‚Äôs fair to say we were only just close during jc for the sake of having a support system through the stress. and i guess that‚Äôs because i couldn‚Äôt really vibe with them rly well? perhaps only one of them but we don‚Äôt even hang after a levels lol 

so yea i‚Äôm just feeling q depressed and lonely rn bc i‚Äôm seeing how my other jc schoolmates hang out and gather together frequently on ig stories, and i‚Äôm rly envious of them to still hang tgt even after school & exams. it‚Äôs such a blessing to have a constant group of close friends to hang out with frequently 

don‚Äôt tell me to not compare because really, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that toxic / bad to be envious of others and self reflect once in a while

and it‚Äôs not like i can really ask my jc friends out because like i said we don‚Äôt rly vibe (and i cant rly be bothered to try too cos i know we can‚Äôt force connections) i still keep in touch w my sec sch friends but we‚Äôre rly just acquaintances who will meet once or twice every few months 

and for the very few 2-3 friends who i can rly vibe well with, we haven‚Äôt see each other for a v long time so it‚Äôs kinda awkward to ask them out and hang 1 on 1 for like a few hrs (it‚Äôs like a temporary getaway from the feeling of being lonely and that‚Äôs about it, kinda pointless imo) 

what i wld want is a close knitted group of friends where everyone connects well with each other and wld hang frequently (once every 1-2 weeks)? where we wld sustain a constant communication via texts, and u can rly tell anything to and confide in, not those friends who u know will be ‚Äúthere‚Äù when u hit them up kinda thing u know? it just hits different 

i‚Äôm also q an introverted person who takes time to open up, but once i rly connect well with u and open up i‚Äôm q fun to be around with (taken from one close friend of mine LOL) so ya i don‚Äôt think i suck at maintaining friendships, it‚Äôs more of the introductory making friends part that‚Äôs hard to me

sooo i was just wondering if it‚Äôs still likely to find constant non-fleeting friendships in university bc from what i read you don‚Äôt rly get to stick with the same bunch of friends all the time unlike in pri sch to jc, and coupled w the heavier workload, it makes friendships harder to maintain

i just don‚Äôt want to graduate and step into the working society lonely af without gaining a constant group of friends from my education lol :,,)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr6gz3/postexamsuniversity_is_it_still_possible_to_find/,153,"[""Can but it's harder like u must rly rly rly try haha.

I found a really close group of friends in my faculty and we are still close even after (disrupted) exchange and we are going into our final year soon. \n\nIt could be because my faculty is small and we have to take a lot of core mods together, so we spend a lot of time studying for the same modules.\n\nEven so, I think that uni is a good place to forge lasting friendships, because\n1) People are more mature than in JC (hopefully LOL)\n\n2) The different projects/groupwork/activities in your modules or CCA mean that you get to interact with different people all the time, hence it‚Äôs easier to find people you vibe with.

Anyway the bottom line is just be yourself, be genuine and you will attract the people that vibe with the real you.

One of the fastest way to get a ""clique"" fast would be to stay on campus halls/RCs since you have a bunch of people you can interact with daily, that said don\'t try to be someone you are not, just be yourself and make youself comfortable among ur peers. However, remember that friendships are a two way thing, no matter how much effort u put in, if the other party doesn\'t seem interested in returning the favour, it might be best to move on and forge new friendships elsewhere. As someone did not stay on campus, i threw myself into many freshmen activities in the hopes of making new friends and connecting with seniors, one thing i realised quickly is that everyone else (esp those who don\'t stay on campus) are also finding friends to be with and form cliques. The first sem is usually where most ppl are still finding their groups to be with and open jio-ing on your orientation group for ppl to bid moudles is a good start. I started my first sem going to lectures and tutorials alone but throughout the sem i asked people who i knew from orientation if they wanted to study together and grab dinner, and now i have a small but close group of friends (can be counted with 1 hand haha) that i rely on for support whenever shit hits the fan.

Even then, it's free seating so anyone you meet in class would be pretty transient. It's not like JC where you stay with your classmates most of the day for the whole week.\n\nBecause of this, you kind of need to proactively join CCAs, camps, and initiate conversation to start up friendships. After that, you got to maintain it by occasionally chatting them up or meeting them.

"[O Levels] 189 for PSLE, 12 raw for OLevel L1R4",O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585466199.0,"Hello! I know getting a l1r4 12 raw for olevel may not be very good as there are way many more ppl getting single digit for r4 and even r5! But to me, I feel that my results are quite desirable and I‚Äôm happy with what I‚Äôve achieved!
4 years ago, I got a 189 for psle but I wasn‚Äôt feeling dejected or disappointed(probably because I was still too young at the age of 12). I didn‚Äôt study for psle and I didn‚Äôt care about my results and how i‚Äòve fared for psle. I got a D for Science, C for English, C for Math and C for Chinese. Yes, I failed Science üòê But I thought getting a 189 was good enough, until I realised that many doors were closed for express stream. A mere 188 is the least to achieve in order to get into an express stream in a neighbourhood secondary school. However, I was glad that I achieved 189 for psle, and not lower(if not unable to even get into express stream). I even selected the NA stream for some schools, just in case I couldn‚Äôt get into my first few express stream choices. I got into a neighbourhood secondary school(cop was 188). It was then I realised how badly I‚Äôve fared for psle(when I started sec 1 and my friends started comparing psle results). My friends had close to 200, even some with 200+
Secondary school was a fresh start for me and I decided to work my ass off to achieve good grades for olevel. Despite failing Science in psle, I had the opportunity to take Pure Science during Sec 3, surprisingly! I knew things were gonna be difficult if I took double pure science, but I took up the challenge(pure phy and pure chem) and I‚Äôm glad I did! Although there were a few times I felt like giving up and dropping to combined science, I persevered through and WOW like I have never gotten a B for Pure Science before but shockingly in OLevel I did! From upper sec onwards, I had alot of tuition classes, like ALOT ! AMath, EMath, Pure Chem, Pure Physics, English, Chinese. My weekends were packed as heck(with classes starting as early as 9am and ending at 5pm on Saturdays). I had many sleepless nights in upper sec and I drank lots of coffee to keep myself awake. I would always stay up to revise especially when exams are on the next day. I know, this is my bad habit. I love to cram the night before and I even did so during the olevel period. But this was the only method that worked for me, so I had no choice. I stayed up for Common Tests, MYE, Prelims, and OLevel. I lost many hours of precious sleep but I tried my best to stay up only when necessary. I sat for Olevel in 2019 and when I received my results 2 months ago, I was shocked to see myself getting a 12 raw for r4 and 16 raw for r5. A1 for AMath, EMath, Chinese, C6 for English(HAHA but glad I didn‚Äôt fail though), B3 for Combined Humanities, B4 for Pure Chemistry. I decided to continue my education via the poly route and is currently waiting for poly semester 1 to start in April.
What I would like to say is that, psle grades don‚Äôt define you(maybe even olevel too). However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt put in hard work and not take exams seriously. A quote I live by especially during olevel period was: Work Hard, Play Hard. It is okay to rest and procrastinate for some days, I do as well! Everyone is a human being and we get tired on some days as well. Don‚Äôt drain yourself too early though(advisable to revise part by part) 
Always do and COMPLETE your TYS !! Review questions that you made a mistake, clarify and ask questions if you‚Äôre unsure, NEVER leave doubts !!! Thanks for reading till here.

For students who are using a combination of loans &/or subsidies to settle their MOE subsidised tuition fees, the disbursement sequence is as follows:

-Mendaki Tertiary Tuition fee Subsidies (MTTFS) where applicable

-PSEA funds where applicable

-CPF funds under the CPF Education Scheme where applicable

-Tuition Fee Loan (TFL) where applicable

-Study Loan (SL) where applicable

[uni] is law the one for me,University :snoo_smile:,1585449696.0,"i‚Äôm a j1 and i was thinking about possible uni courses to pursue, i‚Äôm pretty lost. law seems quite interesting to me and may be in one of my choices. but i‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs the one for me. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll really enjoy it or not while studying it or pursuing it. maybe i just don‚Äôt know enough. how do i know if that‚Äôs the one for me to pursue? (i take 4h2 pcme btw) can some seniors share their experiences or what makes them want to take up law and how did you decide that‚Äôs what you wanted to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqya90/uni_is_law_the_one_for_me/,3,"['Hi OP! I graduated from a local law school last year and I remember being in the same position as you back in JC.\n\nMy overall advice to you is to just follow your interest and try for law school! As clich√© as it sounds, **you won\'t know unless you try**. I know it\'s daunting because at the age of 16/17, you haven\'t had enough life experience and yet you have to decide on a university course - which has a bearing on your future. But life is a continual self-discovery process and it\'s all trial-and-error. And we all grow as individuals and our interests can change from time to time, so even what you want now may not be what you want say 5 years down the road. But that\'s perfectly ok! You currently have an interest in law and that\'s a good starting point for you to choose where to go. If you subsequently find that law is not for you, you can always change course or change your career direction. I have several law school batchmates who discovered that law wasn\'t for them and moved on to other areas (such as IT). Ok my point is that: (1) you don\'t have to be absolutely certain that law is for you before you opt for law as your uni course choice; (2) there\'s no way you can be absolutely certain and (3) there is always flexibility in switching out of law if you dislike it.\n\nI know there is notion that ""you have to be passionate about law"" before opting for law school. I completely disagree with this. As I mentioned, I believe that passion can change and that passion can also be cultivated. I also find that this term is not helpful to a young student who is still exploring his interests in life. What I do however believe is that law is a very vast diverse field and that there is something in it for most people. You won\'t find yourself interested in all areas of the law. But as long as you are curious about learning about the world or about people, there\'s bound to be an area of law that you are interested in. Because ultimately, there are many legislation/regulations on all (if not most) areas of our lives and economic sectors. For example, if you are like a tech geek who likes to read about the latest products and innovations and are interested in news (such as the dispute between Apple and Creative), you may like patent law. If you like a budding investor who likes to read up about shares and mergers (Grab-Uber), you may like corporate law. If you are passionate about social issues like s 377A or the mandatory death penalty, you may like criminal/ constitutional law. If you like reading about controversial issues such as euthanasia and abortion, you may like medical law. If you like reading about global issues such as Rohingya crisis, you may like public international law. There\'s just so many areas of law that you definitely will find sth you like! So I don\'t think that you shouldn\'t be overly concerned that you would lack interest in the law. \n\nBut of course if you are curious about how law is like - just pick up a law textbook. It doesn\'t have to be a law textbook for law students because the legal jargon might turn you off. You can even pick up say a Business Law textbook for business students. Or you can pick up a criminal law textbook (I believe most people will find crim as a more lively and interesting area of law). Anything you think you would be interested in really. If you are curious about the practice of law, you can take up an internship with a law firm. I think there\'s this Singapore Academy of Law JC programme thingy where you can shadow a lawyer. Or you can write in to a law firm - but they may make you photocopying lol. But that\'s ok because you get to see what the work environment is like. But anyway the practice of law on the other hand is different from law school and another beast altogether - I\'m at this stage right now (as a trainee) and it has been painful lol. \n\nBut that being said, I do think the study of law is NOT for everyone. I can\'t emphasise this enough - **if you hate reading and writing, stay away from law school**. How the law works is that the court follows common law (i.e. previous court decisions) or statutes (e.g. Penal Code). So you will have to read lots of textbooks, court judgments (which can go up to hundreds of pages) and academic commentaries on how to interpret statutes, etc. You will basically be a bookworm stuck in the library throughout law school. You will be reading, reading and reading. And law school doesn\'t just want you to know what the law is - you are expected to also think what the law should be. So you have to be prepared to read a lot to make an informed opinion on various legal issues. And you have to write a lot - like legal memos, research papers of 6,000 words, etc. Trust me, you will be fucking miserable in law school if you hate thinking, reading and writing and communicating. And this probably applies for all courses but especially so for law school - if you hate studying in general, don\'t go to law school. \n\nAnyway I just want to say that law school is extremely tedious (it makes JC look easy on hindsight). So you must be prepared to work your ass off if you want to go to law school. But it\'s extremely rewarding at the same time and I feel like I have gained so much from law school and became a better thinker. So notwithstanding the challenge, I would still highly encourage you to go to law school if you are interested in law!\n\nOk I\'m sorry Idk how I ended up typing so much haha. But I hope this helps. And OP, all the best in JC and in finding your direction! Just chill and enjoy your JC life for now. I\'m sure everything will work out in the end!', ""You still have quite some time before you have to make a decision. I would suggest that you take up an internship during the school holidays (this applies to nearly every discipline, not just Law).\n\nYou won't be doing much since you have little to no legal knowledge but you'll get to see the rigour of practice. Go for smaller firms because they're usually more willing to mentor you. Iirc, there's also a Junior College Law Programme that's open to JC students."", ""Speak to lawyers? Hit me up if you want an intro and connection. I'm surrounded by lawyers lol."", 'thank you so much! and also if i like the process of studying a subject like gp, do u think it‚Äôll make the tedious process of studying for law easier? i am interested in law, but the amount of studying, reading, writing seems a little daunting and scary ngl. but i also get how it will be rewarding after it all.', 'Haha np! Yes, I do think that there\'s a high chance you\'ll enjoy studying law if you enjoy studying GP! Studying for law and GP would be similar as both require you to perform research, read and analyse various differing opinions on the same issue, and form your own opinion and argue it persuasively. I would say GP trains you well for law!\n\nI also think it helps indirectly if you enjoy your science subjects. Some parts of law can be quite ""sciencey"". Because in many law school exams, they give us like a hypothetical scenario and ask us to advise a client. So we always have to refer to previous court decisions and argue whether those cases are similar/different to our given scenario and then conclude how the law should apply. I think it\'s similar to science cos we also study certain concepts/theories and have to apply them to our exam questions.', 'oh i see, that‚Äôs cool! thanks again!', 'are you studying law at the moment? in nus?', 'I graduated from NUS Law last year! :)', 'ahh I see, cool!']","[1585464839.0, 1585457817.0, 1585619406.0, 1585465624.0, 1585468728.0, 1585476544.0, 1585476592.0, 1585486212.0, 1585516894.0]","[21, 5, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1]"

[JC] Rant about something's that's been on my mind for a while,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585412516.0,"
Hi, so I'm a J1 student and I've been enjoying my school life so far, having made a lot of friends (far more than I had when I was in sec sch and poly) and everyone in my class just seems really nice and friendly and I could get along with all of them pretty well. There's hardly any segregation into cliques in my class, so I'm really happy and grateful for that because I've never experienced that before in my whole life.

Until a few days ago.

Context: I'm the type of person to overthink things a lot and I've been trying to push it down ever since I entered JC because I wanted to be a brand new person and try to be as happy as I can be, but it's only been working out for the past month. My old anxieties of 'what if I offend this person' 'what if I say the wrong stuff' 'are they talking about me behind my back' 'did I say something wrong, why are they ignoring me (not on purpose, maybe I spoke too softly)' and these thoughts just fill up my mind and I slowly start to become more quiet and everyone notices it (because I'm quite loud and rambunctious in class and among friends) and ask me what's wrong and all, and I just shrug it off and smile again and everything's well again, so it seems.


These toxic thoughts keep filling up in my head recently and I don't know why. It's not like I've offended anyone (so I thought) but I keep getting the feeling that most people in class are sick of my cheery attitude in class and trying my best to answer questions in lectures and tutorials and it's really been hampering how I behave in class. And I want it to stop, but I don't know how to.

I'm really scared to voice it out to my friends because I don't want them judging me and thinking that I put on an act of being cheery and loud because that's who I want to be in class, that's who I want to be in order to feel happy. I'm hiding secrets, such as my sexuality, to them because I'm afraid that they might be homophobic (they often use 'gay' as like a funny term to describe a person's behaviour, and I don't really like it but I didn't ask them to stop either, and I just feel so shitty inside like I'm letting all of my fellow gays down) There're things that I don't fully agree with them either and sometimes I let them be known and I just feel like it's negatively impacting my friendships with them. 

There's a lot on my mind now, but it's midnight, so I can express only these thoughts coherently now. Thanks for reading it all, if you made it down here, and it's my first Reddit post that isn't a comment or reply to something haha. Good night! 

P.S. if you can give me some advice about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Thank you! And if not, thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqn8bg/jc_rant_about_somethings_thats_been_on_my_mind/,15,"[""I feel that the first step in forging new friendships is to be *authentic* and *sincere*, so as to let others know who you are. (not trying to say that you should share your personal stuff to new friends, as that's too early) Based on my various experiences, a real and lasting friendship is one where you can be comfortable in, talk and do whatever on your mind (as long as it's not illegal or harmful to anyone) and do not fear any judgement from your friends. (they accept you for who you are, vice versa) It's normal to overthink at times (I do that sometimes as well) but what you think may actually differ from what others think, so always remind yourself to avoid jumping into conclusions or you can engage them and find out what they feel/think, etc. (if needed) A piece of important advice is to have effective mutual communication so as to understand each other better and this will prevent any misunderstandings from occurring. Lastly, just be *yourself* and those who like you will stay and those who don't can just leave! (it's impossible to befriend everyone in life)"", 'i feel like sometimes, real friendship is also based off vulnerability; maybe you find people that u can trust? and i think it‚Äôll be better to talk to them, for they‚Äôll trust you if you trust them.', ""Ahhhh im not an expert on this but just wanna let you know that I've been at that point as well. The part where you shared about how you are afraid of offending others hits me. Maybe its just human nature to chase after transient glitters.\n\nAnyways, I feel like many times when we are going through such things, we often skew our sense of perception because people who feel they are unable to forge genuine bonds tend to seek it even more. What I am trying to say is, the way you feel they felt might not necessarily be true or rational.\n\nWith that said, should it be true, I think sometimes its good to self-check. Personally, I have noticed that people who are irksome are not those who ask questions in class, but those who gives off an air of superiority. I think if you love answering and asking questions, you are most probably under greater scrutiny, but I think you should deal with this not by shying away, but by being more aware and perceptive of the kind of vibe ure giving off either unconsciously or intentionally. Anyways, one way to get rid of this is to just actively help others or give others a chance to answer. I tend to only answer my tutor's questions when its left hanging or unable to be answered or when Im super excited and a fair portion are sharing their opinion, GP.\n\nHmm as much as I would like to share how the best bonds I have forged are through moulded or shared interests, I understand this is super hard for JC because theres only 20 people in each class. Also, I wont give the advice of how genuity and authenticity moulds friendship because, it don't. For example, if I have a bad-temper and I chose to be genuine and honest about it, sorry, it just doesnt work.\n\nBut with that said, I think that line has some truth in it in the sense that friendships are not formed by being overly intentional and it should feel fluid and un-staged. I guess at this point, its finding that one person in the group that shares similar interests and thoughts. You would often realise how many are also just trying to fit in while laughing at the 'gay' joke. Maybe by not laughing at it (which i always TRY not to), people would find you authentic and seek solace in your presence. Ever since JC, as much as I have made a fair bit of offensive jokes, I have rarely laughed or joined in jokes that I don't believe in, even if it is funny. \n\nFor example, in NS, I had a few buddies who do get bullied, but I have never joined in to laugh at them or mock them deliberately and I would love to think that that established my boundaries. The only time I find it alright and fun to mock them is when I know they are in it too. That actually helped me to forge deeper connections with my platoon mates and even among those who gets bullied."", 'agree with the many comments. awkwardly it isn\'t that everyone will like you for you/who you are in life. awkwardly i never had numerous of great/true/genuine friends in school life other than possibly ite period but outside sch, work/tuition/enrichment/kpop/cpop/game i do have countless of friends whom i can call friends truly(there for you/wouldn\'t judge you over every matter) etc. i\'ve always wondered if im the problem what not when i was schooling/younger. but humans are superficial, insecure, inferior issues. aka you can\'t ""please"" everyone & that was never solely ""one\'s"" issues what not.  \n\n1 always just ensure if everything is mutual if it works/doesn\'t work. like you can make efforts to make things work but if the other party really just isn\'t keen then forget it really. you know it takes 2 hands to clap in all relationships.  \n2 i def do agree being yourself/outspoken isn\'t that norm in my days. unsure about now. eg ""everyone likes a/b/c but you like d/e/f hence you are always being the odd one out etc"" / you have a mind of your own for opinions/aren\'t easily wavered by others to fit to the norm etc.  \n3 so long you did not hurt anyone\'s feelings / be it intentional or unintentional nor ofc not harm anyone physically or etc.. there isn\'t anything wrong. a great number of people are not self aware/even as you grow older/start working/adapting to adulting etc. ; so long you are aware/responsible/accountable of what you are doing.  \n\nthen generally i guess you are fine. society does make people introverts too : D üòÖ', 'i feel that as long as you‚Äôre being you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. bc tbh no one has the right to tell you what‚Äôs right or wrong. everyone‚Äôs different and unique in their own ways. if they start calling you names, just ignore them bc it‚Äôs not worth it getting sad over these people bc they‚Äôre not going to matter much in your life anyways. start finding a group of friends that you‚Äôre comfortable with and you don‚Äôt have to please everybody bc it‚Äôs not your job too. jus continue being you and know that you‚Äôre amazing just the way you are and don‚Äôt ever let anyone else tell you otherwise! ‚ô•Ô∏è', ""I totally get the last part especially; I've lost so many people by just being who I am; last time I had a great genuine friendship was when I was in primary school oop\n\nI'm just scared of losing them, I guess. That's my worst fear, because if I lose them, then I will have to suffer being alone again for another 2 years. I don't think I am mentally and emotionally strong enough to handle it again if I lose more friends when I speak my thoughts out 100%, so I try to think through things before I speak out often, in fear of offending them. It's so hard with that too, cause people don't usually tell you to your face when you offend them, so whenever there's a slightly negative change to my friend's behaviour towards me (like maybe ignoring me a little), my brain just jumps to the conclusion that I've offended her someway. And then I try to track back with our convos and try to find out what was it that I said that could have offended her. And that makes me second-guess the whole convo and I'm so tired of doing that. I wish I could try to care less of what everyone thinks of me, I really try to act like I'm insensitive to what my friends are potentially talking about me, but sometimes (like now) it fails and I spiral down a self-hate hole. \n\nI did try my best to be like who I am and want to be by being outgoing (because that's how I am with people close to me) and it was generally well-received. So I technically have no reason to be self-hating and overthinking things right now, but it still happens.

[A LEVELS] Drop from h2 to h1 chem?,A Levels :snoo:,1585405669.0,"
Context: I‚Äôm a j2 considering to drop h2 to h1 chem. I currently take 4H2s (Chemistry, Math,Econs, History) 
Got S for Chem promos in j1 and definitely sure I‚Äôm gonna get a similar grade for block tests. I hate practical, always the last to finish practical in my class and  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not doing any science related or engineering course

Should I drop from h2 to h1 chem or is it too late? Would taking 3H2s really diminish my ability to get scholarships compared to those with 4H2s?
What if I want to study law? Will those with 4H2s be selected before me?

For actual A levels I got an A HAHA i found the syllabus of H1 chem much easier to grasp and it was easier to score. While there are still some application questions, as long as you know everything the syllabus requires you to know, you should be fine. I found h2 chem so hard to score because unlike h1, all the questions were so abstract and weren‚Äôt taught directly in my school notes. also no, it won‚Äôt impact your chances to for Law :-). context: I eventually got 90rp for As and i‚Äôm shortlisted for SMU law & scholarship!! NUS unfortunately hasnt got back to me yet. even if you wanna apply overseas, h1 probably won‚Äôt disadvantage you either.

IMO, you should drop to H1 chem if you don't need chem as a prerequisite for your future courses, for instance medicine or dentistry.\n\nThere are people in this thread that said how H1 Chem bellcurve is high, but that's because the subject itself is easy. There's only so much they can test you and pretty much every question are the same concept over and over again. The only things that's even remotely difficult in H1 Chemistry are the extension topics, Nanomaterials and Polymers but at the end of the day, it's just memory work.\n\nLooking at last year's A level paper, it was a VERY easy paper. The topics that required memory work didn't come out and the questions was more of 'common sense' rather than a lot of thinking and memory work. \n\nPersonally, I'm very thankful that I chose H1 Chem over H2 chem since i HATE practical and chemistry in general and I have no interest in medicine or dentistry so I had a very easy life in JC. At the end of the day? your RP matters more than your 4H2 vs 3H2-1H1"", ""hi! I took the exact same subject combination as you and dropped to H1 chem as well. however, I dropped in jan so my experience may be different. I knew that I wasn't interested in science courses etc. and I was doing terribly for chem (quintile 1 for prelims and either s/u the whole of j1), which was why I dropped even though many had reservations about me dropping.\n\nwhile I do admit it's much easier to cope,  you also need to put in effort. taking h1 chem helped me a lot by freeing my timetable (wo all the practical slots). I improved from U in promos to an A in a levels, but its not a guaranteed remedy. For the batch of 2018 in my school, the A rate was only 14.1%Even for prelims, I still knew of people that got U so you need to be sure that you are willing to put in the effort.\n\nIt really took a lot of my time to improve my j1 chem since my foundation was so weak in the basics like chem bonding etc. Even aft dropping to H1 chem, my mct was just a C, then slowly a B in a mock test and A for MYE and prelims. I had to complete every piece of homework, ask questions, consulr teachers, and complied commonly asked questions from all the test papers. \n\nEen if you drop now, it's possible to do well, which was what some of my classmates managed to do. They dropped aft MYEs but got an A for prelims!\n\nHope this has helped you gain more insight! All the best for your j2 journey! Remember rp is always the first consideration for choices of courses by the unis!"", ""I would say for Law, drop it since I doubt is one of the pre-requisites\n\nBut do note that H1 Chem's A rate is very high, there are certain topics that are marked in the same rigour as H2, and scoring As in school doesn't mean As in A Levels\n\nAnd not taking a H2 Science does mean you have more time since there are less papers. I took PMEc and compared to my PCMe friends in my school, I would say it is less time consuming"", '^second this. i consistently scored As for internal exams but got a B in A levels. it‚Äôs really difficult to score A for H1 chem, apparently both papers have to be almost perfect scores.

[A Levels] Tough experience in JC and how i overcome it,A Levels :snoo:,1585403225.0,"I have come across many posts about tough life in sch,feeling left out and even bullied on reddit. Thus i wanna share my experience in JC to inspire you guys!

In JC i was motivated to study and get to know my peers. However,they were exclusive. What shocked me is the fact that they created a group without a bunch of us to cyber bully us and mock us( i wont go into details) 

At first i was rlly shocked and affected by it. I went to school everyday thinking about their hurtful comments and i felt vengeful. They even laughed at us openly.  

I dreaded lessons. I rlly wanted to study and do well but the thought of them being there rlly made it hard to concentrate without those hurtful remarks circulating in my mind. 

What rlly kept me going is the thought that this experience will come to an end eventually. 2 years or 3 years will pass by sooner than you think. For those ostracised and bullied by your peers, remember to keep your end goal in mind, the A levels. Remember JC is still a place for you to prepare for A levels. Whenever your peers throw hurtful remarks at you, remember that eventually this will all stop.

For those bullying their peers mindlessly, thinking it is all in the name of fun, i urge you to think again. Your actions, however minute, will negatively impact one's life. Grow up.

[Uni] US COLLEGE ADVICE,University :snoo_smile:,1585396802.0,"Long post ahead as I‚Äôm going to give some background.

I took my O-Levels in 2015 and got a nett L1R5 of 8. I could have gone to a JC, but I went to a Polytechnic instead as I prefer more hands-on learning. Back in Secondary school I knew I wanted to be a doctor one day even though I did not fully understand what it meant to be one.

I then graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with the Diploma of Biomedical Science with a cGPA of 3.429 out of 4. My GPA in year 1 was 3.3 and 2.8 because of a break-up which I regret getting affected by. In year 2 I decided to study harder and achieved a 3.4 and 3.7. At that point in year 2, I also started to receive more exposure to the healthcare industry and started to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a doctor. In year 3 I worked my ass off and got a 3.9 and 4. While I was in Polytechnic I participated actively in Clubs and Societies and organised multiple activities. After graduating, I also shadowed doctors to further my experience.

I‚Äôm now serving my NS as a Commando Medic and am now even more motivated to be a doctor. I‚Äôll not explain my personal motivation on Reddit, but I have a lot of passion for Medicine and it‚Äôs a career I really wish to pursue. As all of you on here probably know, 3.429 won‚Äôt really get me anywhere close to Medicine locally, even applying through the discretionary pathway will not help. 

I‚Äôve decided that perhaps pursuing Postgraduate Medicine is a better option. I‚Äôve gotten offers for Biomedical Science from several Australian GO8 Universities I applied to. Because I did Biomedical Science in SP, I received advanced standing and am able to complete a BSc in Australia in 1.5 to 2 years. Which means that if I decide to study in Australia I will be able to attain an MD within 6 years (I‚Äôll be 28). 

I used to think that perhaps getting an MD as fast as possible would be the better option, but I now have a different mindset. I would love to be exposed to as many things as I can during my Undergraduate years and do not mind studying 4 years Undergrad + 4 years Postgrad. I‚Äôve applied to YNC and am on the Waitlist. Hopefully they do offer me or I will apply again.

I‚Äôve decided to apply to US colleges as well as I do not want to limit my options. Any idea of my chances with these colleges? I‚Äôm interested in John Hopkins/UCLA/UC Berkley/UCSD/NYU/UWash/Gerogetown.

i've been feeling this way for a few months, i think since prelims started in august. i have always felt lonely since then because that was when everyone started mugging hardcore for o levels. i didn't do well for prelim, i got 41 points and i accepted that because i was always at the bottom of the cohort and did nothing to improve until the end. i knew it was my fault and i was struggling the entire time. especially during that study break between prelims and o level, i was going for hours of consultations and staying in school from morning to evening to study on my own. some days i had one classmate who was there with me and i'm really grateful for her and i don't blame my friends for not wanting to study with me because i would have slowed them down though but i really couldn't help but to feel so lonely :(

o levels itself was difficult for me too, everyday i was wondering whether i'll even be able to go anywhere and was coming back home crying after every period. it was a difficult period and i was really excited for o level to end and have fun and all

but two weeks after Os ended, my family was supposed to go overseas for a holiday that we have been planning for since june and i was really looking forward to it but my grandma died the day before we were supposed to fly :( she died from stroke alone at her house. when i saw her, all i saw was a cold dead body and blood and it was so traumatizing. i'm still crying over her death and i feel so miserable but i dont know how to be okay again

the rest of the holidays passed by blurry i dont really remember anything, i was just at home and sad. results day came by and i was happy because i managed to go from passing 2/6 subjs to 5/6 subjs, which was enough for me. managed to join MI and was looking forward to it for a fresh start...

but i dont know. i really dont regret going there, i got into a cca i liked, i met some really nice people but im so exhausted and tired... like i said i'm really dreading to go to sch... i'm the only person in my sch who went there. the daily commute from one of the estates in the east to bukit batok is really really tiring and i just want to stopüò≠üò≠üò≠ i just want to give upüò≠ also after a month of school i moved to a new house. we moved to take care of grandma because she had dementia and some other health issues but she died before we could move and our new house is so near to her house (i can see her block when i look out of my house) and it makes me feel so sad everyday... :( it doesnt help that i still do not have a friend group and i dont really have anyone that i can talk about more personal stuff too... all my close friends from sec sch went to the same few jcs in the east and theyre all so happy and it hurts everytime i open ig and see them all together

i feel like i've lost interest in everything i hate everything that i used to like in sec sch like mt lessons pe lessons and recess because i dont have friends. everytime after lessons i just sit in the library and either cry or tear up because i thought of how i've never felt this way before in sec sch and i felt so sad... i miss my friends and i feel so lonely... i know its kind of my fault that i dont have friends because i somewhat isolate myself... talking to people has became so tiring and i find it so damn difficult to make friends with anyone... :( its so tiring i talk to someone for awhile then i have no energy anymore and i just give up. now during recess i choose not to eat too because i dont know i would just rather go lib

i dont know guys thank you if you've read until here i just really feel so horrible i've been crying everyday its so hard to adapt and cope and accept my fact that my grandma is dead and that i have a new school and new house and no friends and all these changes are so overwhelming for me. im so tired and i want to just not bother about anything but i chosw to do a levels to prove myself wrong that im not useless worthless hopeless like i think i am but at this point of time im really just really so close to giving up

tldr ; dread gg to sch, sad and lonely, no friends, new sch is alm 2 hours away from home, just moved to new house, grandma died, miserable all the time

edit ; i forgot to add but ive been going for school counselling for almost a month but recently my counsellor said that she suspects i have depression and would like to refer me to external parties. thing is, i'm scared because i have my own doubts and if i do get referred outside, def my parents have to know. im not sure if they really understand what depression is. honestly, i just want to talk to someone who can relate or understand how i feel like now, or someone who can share with me how seeking help for depression is like :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqi47p/a_levels_sad_and_lonely_how_to_not_dread_school/,130,"['Wah, i would have chosen poly route if I were you.

Grief is normal, and from your post, it seems as if this is totally justifiable, but i think if it gets very debilitating and makes you a low-functioning person, I would suggest to book an appointment with either the School Counsellor or a Clinical one. Grief is complicated and people expresses it in different ways. Seek your friends for support, and not for reliance. As much as many of them would love to think, none of them are equipped to deal with these emotions and worse, it might cause a strain between your friendships. Seek an expert on it, talk about it, and if it works, thats great, if it doesn't there are still many outlets. Depression tends to skew your sense of perception and perspective, know that the negative emotions you experience might be irrational and unfunded, I hope that gives you some sense of relief. If you need some support, I am here :). \n\nTldr; friends are not equipped with skills to deal with complex emotions, DONT rely on them. Seek consultations with a psychatrist to discuss plans moving forward :). Best of luck anon"", ':( .If you need anyone to rant to feel free to dm me', 'If you need anyone to talk to just dm me, cheer up :)', 'i did think abt poly vs MI alot of times but i just decided to go to MI because i have no interest in any courses in poly (i kind of not have any interest in anything in life now but oh well). i prefer classroom environment as compared to hands on group work or project work so... i decided to do A level to give myself a second chance after doing so badly for Os and for all those fuckups during sec sch.
