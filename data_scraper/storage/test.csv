"[A levels] Being mediocre is worse than failing rn, I need advice",A Levels :snoo:,1586241152.0,"I am a J2, taking PCME. For the majority of J1 and now my MCTs, I've been getting average marks for my exams except econs (S) lmao. Initially, I was satisfied with getting 50s as I knew JC was tough. But over time, I just got worse and worse. Despite this, every time exam season kicks in, I put in a lot of effort and just about manage to scrape another 45-50 for each subject. 

So some of you may ask, what's the issue? I should be ok or even happy with my passes right? Well, being mediocre means you are neglected by the teachers who think you have done OK. This means not being down for remedials and teachers not checking my work etc. I have taken advantage of this, and not done a lot of my tutorials, which I think will eventually lead to my downfall. 

This is why I say being mediocre is worse than failing right now, because I end up becoming satisfied over my average marks and proceed to slack. Of course now that I have identified the problem, I want to address it. But the problem is I do not know any way of studying consistently and I feel quite scared to consult my teachers because I'm scared of getting whacked for asking those type of basic qns (esp by my strict math teacher).

Now with HBL, I am able to study at home which I think is better because I can consult virtually. But can anyone share tips and advice on how to pick up discipline and study consistently to improve myself from just being average/mediocre?

Sorry but i dont think having such work ethic will leave u having plenty of choices in ur uni application. People always adopt such attitude and work ethic which causes themselves to shoot themselves in the foot and regret it later which i find it absolutely foolish.

okay so ill summarise my situation right now.

i want to go for a lit based course in uni and was aiming for a scholarship as well, and hence aimed for an arts stream, bc i knew i could do rly well, and get a good rank point. i mean, youll be more likely to get a scholarship with a better rank point right?

but i was forced by my parents to go into the sci stream, and the only way i could take h2math and h2chem as they wanted was if i went into mi, so here i am, in mi, taking h2 math and h2 chem.... both subjs that im like only okay at. need to put in alot of effort esp bc i didnt take amath or pure sci, and my math isnt that good in general.

(im taking a h2 lit which is the only thing im rly happy w learning and stuff haha)

anyways

im stuck here... in mi for 3 years.... to learn sciences i really dont want to... and bc of this my rank point is most probably gna be lower than what it might be in an arts stream... 

so i just want to know: 

1) does my possibly lower rank point situation affect my chances of getting a scholarship in a lit based course?

2) people who are/were stuck in sci stream when you wanted art stream, any advice or words of encouragement to get me through these three years? anything is helpful!

Topic: military \ncategory: military in the government/military regime\ncase studies:\n\ncategory: military subservient to govt\ncase study: singapore\n\ncategory: politicised military but not in govt\ncase studies:\n\nThis way you can identify the case study that best shows a certain scenario and only memorise that one case study properly and use it whenever you have to write an argument on that topic.\n\nYou can also prepare stock arguments that are commonly written.\n\ne.g  military regime successful in terms of\n\n1. Point X + evidence\n\n2. Point Y + evidence\n\nmilitary failure in terms of \n\nPoint A + evidence\n\netc\n\nThis way you can pre-plan common arguments and use them to revise.

Another way to look at it is to 'study by question' in which you focus on what evidence and details you want to use for each case study in each argument. Of course its also important to note that you may end up not using a lot of the nitpicky details in your notes (because you prob won't remember them) but you must definitely remember the details that help you make a case/further your argument. \n\nOne way to make it easier to remember details is to rewrite the notes in your own style and you can make it more concise by categorizing it by argument/question. Rewriting is generally helpful for memorization, and writing it in your own phrasing might help you remember it more easily.

[META] PSLE Math Rant,META :redditgold: ,1586186585.0,"I posted this like a month ago but it got removed but I checked and it was still on so I was like whaaat. Anyway...

No, I am not taking PSLE this year, but something far worse. My cousins do and they always ask me for help mostly in Math. This has probably been reiterated many times. But I just wanted to rant about something I feel needs to be addressed in the primary school education system. In this particular case, it's for PSLE Math. I don't know why but it's just too difficult to solve those damn questions, especially without the use of simultaneous equations. For me, that is the challenge, doing questions with those god damn models and explaining it clearly to my cousins. 

It's time-consuming for me to think about the questions, and I presume it's worse for them. I remember my upper primary days being stressful and thinking I was stupid for not being able to answer those questions. I remember my parents paying for tuition that tried to teach me simultaneous equations, but I didn't know how to apply. See, I feel like if simultaneous equations were taught earlier then those kids will be less stressed out and have more fun in school.

I've seen people in JC getting 210 for PSLE and even some Normal Acad students excelling in H2 Math and even taking F Math. All I'm trying to say is that PSLE is one of the worst exams ever and I hope the syllabus changes to be a bit more advanced because algebra makes everything super easy. And as seen in secondary school, all algebra takes is a lot of practice to master, and not having to UNDERSTAND confusingly-worded questions and solving using MODELS. 

My hope for this rant is that more people, especially 12-year-olds and their parents, don't see PSLE as life defining because that shit is TOO hard and if they work hard and smart in secondary school everything will work out. 

P.S. Have fun at your last day of real school in a month. Home-based learning is gonna be fun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fw0mdc/meta_psle_math_rant/,104.0,"['Omg yes the amount of times I said ooh wtf this -question for a lower level- would be so much easier if they taught us -concept from a higher level- earlier!\n\nHCF LCM would help me so much in those PSLE Math Qn etc.', ""Yep, definitely feel that PSLE math is way difficult than secondary school and JC math. But I guess that's how MOE identifies IP people."", 'as someone who did well enough in secondary school (E & A) math that i had cohort-level and even national-level awards, holy shit yes PSLE math was not easy, and it‚Äôs gotten way harder now. not *impossible* for really really inclined students i guess, but still...\n\ni actually thought i sucked at math in primary school. i even cried in p4 math class once because i felt dumb.', 'perhaps pri sch math was to train us to use basic logic to solve questions instead of a mathematical approach?? idk but I do agree that it was def harder to study and harder to score i guess', ""LOL I also still can't do psle math whenever I see assessment books in popular"", ""It's a good thing that the use of things like simultaneous equations won't result in loss of marks. \n\n[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318214429/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2007/20070217.htm)."", 'Honestly I feel that the PSLE wasn\'t difficult, just tricky. From my own experience of taking PSLE and looking at other years\' PSLE Math paper, all the questions were able to be solved using the methods that the teachers taught from the syllabus, stuff taught from outside the syllabus only made our lives easier such as the simultaneous equation method. From what I saw in the ""killer questions"", those just required some out of the box thinking and looking things from another perspective sometimes. \n\nThe main reason that people seem to overlook is that PSLE is set by SEAB, while O and A levels are set by Cambridge in partnership with SEAB. The reason people find O and A levels simpler may be because Cambridge tests for understanding, while SEAB likes to test for the students\' ability to apply concepts. Take the circle question from last year for example. You can see that the question isn\'t difficult, it\'s just testing for the students\' ability to apply their understanding of units and parts, together with their ability to visualise that the two lines are equal. \n\nThere are always questions that are supposed to test your ability to apply, along with questions that test your understanding. This is how MOE differentiates (pun intended) the A students from the A\\* students. ""A"" students should understand concepts fully, while A\\* students should be able to understand the concepts AND apply them correctly. \n\nAlso, if you haven\'t noticed, these ""killer questions"" only make up a small percentage of marks in the paper, around 5-8 marks. Enough for people to go ""Aiyah! I didn\'t get A\\* cos of this question!"" which is ultimately the point of such questions, and it isn\'t the case where ""Aiyah! I fail cos of this question!"", because there are other, simpler questions that test for understanding which make up around 60-70% of the paper.', 'honestly i did quite well in most of the maths exam except that one p5 maths mye paper which i failed badly. So i was a bit complacent and didnt study much for psle maths. End up getting up a B cuz i found the paper quite hard... and i got 213 in psle. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH U. Whenever i look at psle maths, i really wanna use algebra and calculations that i have learnt in sec sch instead of the stupid models. I found sec sch maths(e and amaths) or even jc maths(so far) easier than psle maths. I wish they can implement more algebra concepts from sec sch in primary school then they have more time to grasp the concepts!', ""OP you literally said everything I wanted to say. And I'm still pretty appalled that model drawing is still a thing now, I thought it stayed in my boomer days.\n\nModel drawing and simultaneous equations not being allowed was what made me get C for PSLE math and eventually 209 in a cohort that's already very competitive. Yes I did get blasted for not getting at least 220+ or 230+, but I am not faring worse now just coz I was shit at primary school problem sums, and it definitely never affected my Emath grade."", 'Bro i cannot agree more', 'I get you mean, I am international students so I have to learn psle stuffs before entering sec 1 and I was suffering. I found sec 1 was so much easier and I think that it was because I actually had teachers to teach me sec 1 math whereas I had no teacher for psle math. Eventually, I took O levels and quite confident with my math as I scored A1 for both. Then, some foreigners asked me to help them with psle math because they are trying to get inside sec 1 here as well. I got to say, psle math is still bs. Especially all those words problem, like how do you even use models and ratios to solve ? I got so frustrated at one point and told them to just use algebraic method because it‚Äôs so much easier. Have said all of that though, once you figure out how to actually solve those questions using model and ratio, you will appreciate it more..', 'Some find it difficult, others find it easy. All part of the bell curve.', 'psle maths is not maths ots logic puzzles LOL', 'Math is not about solving the question and getting numbers. MOE is teaching math in a way that forces students to THINK, analyse the problem and draft up an appropriate path to the solution. I strongly believe this is an integral part of education and it should start young.\n\nWhat I really hate about is secondary schools and JCs teaching math mechanically. You see equations and numbers, you don‚Äôt see the meaning, you don‚Äôt see the relevance, you don‚Äôt see why the concept of introduced in the first place.\n\nThe PSLE math questions presents a problem, and uses model to help students analyse the problem (visual learning). This helps them understand the motivation of mathematicians having to invent simultaneous equations, which is more abstract and not every student and understand.\n\nMost primary and secondary school children can solve simultaneous equations easily because you are taught to move numbers around mechanically. That‚Äôs not the point of math. In secondary school you are introduced to calculus, you learn how to differentiate, but have you learnt why the concept of limit was vital? Have you learn how mathematicians moves from infinitesimal calculus to using limits as a foundation? Have you tried to understand why the reverse of differentiation between two point - definite integral - is the area under a graph? Have you learnt why dx behaves like a number when it‚Äôs mathematically invalid to say dx is a number? You don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt understand math the way it should be . MOE is trying to have primary school kids understand math, not move numbers around.\n\nAs an NUS High student, I can clearly see why MOE is designing the curriculum to be that way, because my curriculum require me to think deeper and my exposure to other curriculums in other countries made me understand how they approach math education (ie Hungary) \n\nHungary didn‚Äôt outperform Singapore in PISA, but Hungary‚Äôs math curriculum is said to be one of the most beautiful and elegant; and students understand and APPRECIATE math at a deeper level. Think, why? \n\nAs with sports, math require practice, practice, practice. I cannot stress this enough. Knowing how to read musics notes on Paganini‚Äôs piece doesn‚Äôt make you a violin master, practicing and being able to perform it well does.\n\nWhat‚Äôs disgusting is not the curriculum or the questions being tough, is the\n1) expectation that everyone should be able to solve every question and the \n2) mechanical understanding of math\n3) Parents getting upset because their kids can not solve some problem\n\nYou just have you understand that \n1) Exams are NOT designed to have everyone score a 100%, if you can‚Äôt solve it given all the resources, you have to accept that you have much more to learn \n2) Singaporeans learn math for grades, most understand how to solve but does not truly understand why math is the way it is. 3Blue1Brown is a good example of what _understanding math_ is like.\n3) PSLE is not a major milestone in life, not even close. It‚Äôs only a measure of your academic proficiency at 12 years of age, nothing more. Kiasu mindset is ruining the purpose of PSLE. \n\nPSLE teaches a child more than just the academic content, it also let them taste how real world competition is like. Accept that.', 'i agree that some questions in the current psle math is quite challenging, but i felt that for my year, it was somewhat easier ? \n\ni did well for math in pri sch, as well as psle, yet i still failed/barely passed emath and amath from sec 1-3', 'PSLE math without algebra is doable but yes more difficult compared to simply using algebra.

Although maybe it‚Äôs just my experience, I found score A* in Maths relatively easy, honestly scoring A* in science is much harder because they ask questions that aren‚Äôt taught and requires out of the box thinking which isn‚Äôt usually taught in science since science is founded on facts and logic and not really on assumptions.', 'agreed. psle needs brains, practice and understanding while o level and a level math is just practice and understanding thats all', 'Almost every parent out there cannot accept the fact that their child is not at the top 1% of the curve.', 'Good insight.

[O Levels] I don‚Äôt want to drop Pure Science because I want to go to JC (Arts Stream),O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586172066.0,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm an ‚Äòinternational student‚Äô (but I grew up here) currently Sec 4 taking the typical Pure Science stream. (Bio, Chem, Amaths & Emaths)

Mentioning that I was an international student was relevant because of the fact that I don‚Äôt take Mother Tongue. Instead, I take a 3rd language (French) which I‚Äôm currently doing very badly in lmao

With that said, that can only mean one thing‚Äîif I were to drop to Combined Sciences, it‚Äôll be nearly impossible for me to go to a relatively good JC unless I do extremely well for French. (I‚Äôm currently scoring an E8 lol)

I‚Äôm not doing very well in my Sciences either. I largely blame that on my lack of effort last year. However, right now, I‚Äôm trying much harder to push myself to score better and although I do see improvement, I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs enough.

I‚Äôve only started to buck up at the start of this year and I don‚Äôt think that the slow development in my grades is not a telltale sign that my efforts will be enough to actually do well during my O Levels. I wanted to use the upcoming Mid-year Exams to gauge how well I was coping with my newly reformed attitude (lol) but due to the COVID-19 outbreak, my plans were all ruined.

So now, should I...
- Drop Pure Science since I‚Äôm not coping as well as I should be & there‚Äôs no way to assess if I‚Äôll ever be able to cope with its rigour due to the cancellation of MYE? (Which would mean that to get into a good JC, I would have to do exceptionally well for my 3rd language which isn‚Äôt very realistic)

Or should I...
- Stay in Pure Science and continue to grind with no way to tell if I‚Äôm doing enough and just hoping for the best that I‚Äôll do well during Prelims.

Currently, I‚Äôm aiming for an A1 for both my English and Humanities and A2s for both of my Maths & in my Sciences to go to an Arts Stream in JC. (Yes, I don‚Äôt plan to continue with my Sciences if I were to get into JC) and if I were to score anything greater than 15 points, (raw score) I would much rather go to Poly instead.

I appreciate all of you for taking the time to read this long post. Thank you all!

P.S. Tuition is not a viable option for me. My family‚Äôs income neither earns too much nor too little. It is suffice and cannot support me if I were to go for additional tutoring.

If you avoid French , which I believe language is rather harder to improve compared to Science you May also score distinctions for both your sciences if hard work is put in. You might also wanna think about why you‚Äôre scoring a certain grade for your sciences. As someone who dropped from pure Chem (F9) and pure Bio (B4) before prelims to combined science (A1 for Os) all I can say is that the diff between pure and combined chem is rlly huge. My math sucks so my pure chem suffered. Combined chem is more towards memorising and application (math is very minimal) so I managed to score well for combined chem. The reason why I dropped was bc I was sure I didn‚Äôt need science for my poly course (you might also wanna keep your options open for now, no harm considering poly) \nAnyways, you can think about it (whether for you it‚Äôll be easier to improve your sciences / French etc) then make a decision which to drop/avoid , I did have classmates dropping to combined sci / A Math even after prelims so yeaa...I also did have classmates who got B3/4 for both their sciences but dropped to combined science bc they knew they wanted poly and wanted a lower L1R4 for Os', 'ahh i‚Äôm sorry i must have misread it!! well i guess it rly depends how much you want to go to a ‚Äúgood‚Äù jc?

I have American Transcripts, not O lvl.

I‚Äôm not sure why is that so and the funny thing is that my outcome deadline is set on 9 apr while most others are set on 10 apr. 

I called admissions up to check on the status of my application and the person said that there was no such thing as applying via email.

[o levels] to all those taking o‚Äôs / study tips !,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586165955.0,"hey everyone ! first time making a post here so idk if i‚Äôm doing it right but !
if y‚Äôall have any problems during hbl / just need some help for o‚Äôs i would like to help y‚Äôall !
i took triple pure last year for o‚Äôs ( double sci -chem & bio + pure geog ) , elect lit + ss , double math , chinese and eng ! 
i‚Äôm in no way a model straight a1 or 6 pointer but if u do need any help , feel free to hmu on telegram and i‚Äôll try help u as best as i can ! if u still don‚Äôt understand i don‚Äôt mind calling to explain it to u as well ! let‚Äôs all help each other in this crisis :) 
if you need a listening ear , going thru a hard time or even just need someone to talk to , my telegram is always open ! ü§© 
i just wanted to help the community & give back on this platform that helped me throughout my truly meme-worthy o level period last year üò• 
telegram user : mochiineko 
attached i have some studying tips as well for any who might need it ! 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
1. throw your phone somewhere , put it in airplane mode or if u have forest , use it !!
- trust me , all the texts / notifis rly hinder the revision process , i know you‚Äôve probably heard this a billion times but it does help ! if you‚Äôre someone ( like my dumb self ) who needs google , mute all the social media apps ( or if you‚Äôre on apple , lock it w screentime !) and limit urself to use it solely for school !
i have friends who also asked their parents to confiscate their phones  üò•üò• but i wasn‚Äôt gonna do that to myself LOL
2. notes are actually useless .
TRUST ME IT SOUNDS STUPID BUT notes are only useful if they are YOUR OWN ! we all learn / digest knowledge in our own ways , so unless the note set is made by you to cater to your own knowledge gaps / parts u struggle understanding , it‚Äôs a little useless ( unless u have photographic memory ;-; pls teach me how ) ! so ! even it takes a whole lotta time to make ur own notes , i feel it‚Äôs p worth it if u uds what you‚Äôve written ! if you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôve written , highlight those parts out and ask questions or review them !  if you lack time / spend too much time making such sets , remember that ur notes only need to be KEY POINTS and not the entire textbook, condensed :( , aNd it doesn‚Äôt have to be pretty ! ( ok shoot me cos i love making pretty notes but if they hinder you... pls don‚Äôt... i promise u can make them pretty if u have time !)  ( also if you‚Äôre a visual learner BONUS POINTS cos u can draw out diagrams ! if you‚Äôre not ... I HAVE MORE TIPS )
3. YOUTUBE VIDEOS 
oh yes, i have many teachers who ! don‚Äôt ! explain ! well ! so what do i do ?? go on youtube and search for videos that explain such concepts ! i loved using crashcourse for chemistry & amoeba sisters for biology (bonus is teded but i usually watch it in my free time LOL) it also rly helps bcos of all the animations 

‚Äî‚Äî
i have many more tips that i can‚Äôt think of at the moment but i will compile a google docs when i have more time ! 
i hope i have managed to help any of you out there :)
to everyone pls jiayoussss !! let‚Äôs all get that bread and stay healtHY !

I am looking to specialize as  a software engineer perhaps specialising in the fields of Machine Learning and AI.

Pros and Cons of CN Yang Program that I can think up of:

Pros: Provides for alot of opportunities, networking chances and prestigious (Not sure about this wrt companies). Research experience might prove to be useful in the fields of AI and Machine learning.

Cons: Learn stuff such as triple science etc during the first sem, might fall behind other cs students and career wise (Because these modules are very heavy in content wise = spending less time on cs mods and less free time for personal projects). Also curriculum wise suggest that uni breaks will be spent on things like making & tinkering etc = Less time for self-sourced internships, and less elective slots.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvv8cl/scholarships_cn_yang_program_ntu_cs_vs_nanyang/,0.0,"['May ik what your rp is', 'How did u manage to get the general nanyang scholarship also when u hv alr gotten the cn Yang Scholarship?

[poly] a rant,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1586161989.0,"hello im not sure yall have came across my posts on reddit regarding my admission of poly but i previously had an issue with my enrolment and ranted it here. true enough RP admission office had completely forgotten about my enrolment. called them multiple times but their replies were not helpful at all, sent many emails but did not received any reply. 

long story short, i know a lot of RP students also facing issues because they did not receive any information or received different information from the majority.  

im actually really pissed off at the admission office because they called us back for an induction programme this week and they have not told everyone the time slot they were allocated to...thats like so last minute and theyre making everyone anxious zz. 

eventually most my problems were settled and i‚Äôm just waiting for a final email before i can configure my laptop. 

i have compiled all the different stories of people having bad experience with the people in RP. you judge for yourself.

[ story 1 ] : this girl called the IT dept and was told to school because she was experiencing some admission problems. when she got there, they took down her contact details and they told her to go home and wait. wasted trip. she could not do anything else but to wait.

[ story 2 ] : my friend applied for dae to school of applied sci. a week after the scheduled interview dates, he received a call from rp saying that they missed out his email, and will arrange an interview for him soon, as well as sending an email to notify him by the last day of march. you‚Äôve guessed it, they did not contact him ever since.

[ story 3 ] : this girl had problems with her laptop after configurating it. she gave rp a call and continuously for 15 mins the staff told her to factory reset her laptop, and this girl insisted that she already tried doing so but would not work. the call ended after she argued with the staff. the next day she went to school to solve the issue.

[ story 4 ] : another girl similar issues to mine and she called the office this morning, the staff told her that they will send an email with regards to her configuration of laptop by today. its 10.26pm and you know whats the outcome.

i can confidently when two people call the office and they ask the same questions, they will receive two completely different replies. im not the only one having a bad experience. 

these few days my contact with rp admission office left me speechless. there was not a point in sending them emails because they simply dont bother to reply unless its extremely urgent. they would also missed out some student admissions, but i dont blame them for that because theres alot of people applying. 

one thing they did unforgivable was that they dont send emails or sms by the deadlines, and when they‚Äôre sent out its super last minute. i understand that they sent it out by batches but i think they need to be more efficient. its quite stupid if they send out notifications last minute.

my biggest worry is that they will forget to send me the email for laptop configuration, and i would not be able to seek help because there would be no one in the office as they staff may be working from home. it might caused me to not be able to access the apps and complete my hbl, thu affecting my grades. in the event if this actually happens, i swear im gona give them Hell. im so tired of their nonsense.

[O levels] Dealing with feeling inferior,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1586158903.0,"I feel so demoralised and tired after seeing students from elite schools getting straight As despite them being from elite schools, meaning their papers are more difficult/rigorous.

I don‚Äôt know why but I just feel so overwhelmed, like everything is piling on me. 

I‚Äôm getting no where with my studies. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm already losing sleep for studies, I‚Äôve already did whatever I can, but it‚Äôs still not enough.

It‚Äôs not my fault I learn slower , not my fault if my mother tongue is not English(haish english......),but yet I‚Äôm bearing the consequences of them.(Ok I sound unreasonable and whiny, I just really need to get this off my chest.)

This general feeling of inferiority, jealousy and even contempt towards myself is slowly taking a toll on my emotional health and grades. I find myself blaming genetics(omg eww I‚Äôm sorry for thinking this üòî) and being very pessimistic towards life in general. I know this mindset would definitely not serve me well in the future, and hence am trying change.

How do y‚Äôall deal with this feeling?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fvuh9x/o_levels_dealing_with_feeling_inferior/,12.0,"['is okay to be a slower learner \n\nas long you dun give up on yourself. everybody can say you cannot or you no good but you cannot give up on yourself. \n\njia you :) anyway can PM me or check my profile for my study exp.(I am a slow learner too)', ""Hey there! I took O-Levels last year and all I can say is that you should never give up. I suffered from burnout and depression at the start of sec 4 which made it really hard to focus on my academics as I often found myself digressing into self-doubt and fear of losing out to my peers. \n\nHowever, it was through this that learnt many things about coping with negative emotions:\n\n1. Don't push the blame - regardless of whether the situation that \nyou are in is your fault or not, realise that heaping guilt unto      yourself or others will do Nothing to solve the issues you face learn to ignore such sentiments and focus on your work.\n\n\n2. There is hope as long as you don't give up - Things may seem\nbleak right now as your world may burn down around you. Still, its\nnever over until you decide to give up. As long as you remain focused and motivated to press on through the pain and doubt, your effort WILL show in your results.\n\n3. Learn to enjoy the process - As difficult and far fetched as it may seem, learning to develop a liking for the process of preparing for O-levels will make it easier to cope with the rigour of doing so. I had a friend who is now in an elite JC who used to practice A math everywhere he went, even on the school trip we went on after our exams in sec 3 on the food tray in the plane! To him, he loved practicing as he knew his every effort would pay off which is why he no longer saw it as a burden to practice but instead a part of his daily routine. (He finished the Amath paper 1 in ~40mins so that practice definitely helped)\n\n\n\nSo here are some things I have learnt in secondary school which I found worked for me in preparing for exams in general. I hope that you find out what works for you and succeed in implementing those strategies.\n\nHere's wishing you all the best for O-levels and a memorable journey with the time you have left in the run up to it!"", ""Well... There are late bloomers. There are people who are contented with simple life. There are people who don't mind working harder to reach their goal. \n\nI guess it depends on what you treasure, and whether or not you can take some hardship. I didn't start off in elite schools as well, my secondary school results were shit until I put in effort, and as long as I'm happy with my family now we're ok. Nothing about those high flier to get jealous about. \n\nSo, maybe ask yourself truthfully, what is it that you treasure? And whether or not you need to rethink about what you treasure?"", 'Don‚Äôt have to compare yourself with others. You are what you are. Some people are just great at studying. Some are great at sports. While others are jack of all trades, master of none. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI‚Äôm really proud of you for trying your hardest. Set a mini goal for yourself to achieve, such as getting a grade higher from your previous test. Then, reward yourself for it, such as buying a gift for yourself etc. \nFor me, I find studying with my close friends more effective as they would encourage me and just have fun while learning. \n\nIn life, It‚Äôs a pathway to becoming the best version of yourself. Exam results do matter but you would have no regrets that you already tried your best. Again, comparison does not help at all and it will only cause unnecessary stress and pressure for yourself.

You just have to put more effort on those subjects you find hard. \n\nWhen you study, plan it well. Schedule in such a way that in a week you can cover all subjects. Make sure not to overwhelm yourself when studying. Take one topic at a time. Make us of your lifelines when you can't get it in your own...maybe from your friend who is really good at it or from a tutor.

Please help me with your honest opinions üò£ SUSS and kaplan uni students would be a plus so I have a clearer understanding. My arguments are:

1. SUSS is a 4-year course while the same degree in a kaplan uni is a 1.5-year course.

2. SUSS is mostly self-based learning and students don‚Äôt go to school often as compared to other local unis but pay about the same school fees.

The courses are normally 2.5 to 3 yrs. \n\n1.5yr for a degree course is too short for anyone to gain enough knowledge. As an employer, I‚Äôll doubt the value of this degree. Sorry folks from Kaplan. Just my personal opinion.', 'Here‚Äôs my opinion, as someone from a technical discipline in a standard 4 year local uni, with a pretty fast paced curriculum. I don‚Äôt have much knowledge of SUSS or Kaplan, so take it with a grain of salt please!\n\nWould I have considered myself to be ‚Äòhire-able‚Äô material 1.5 years in? Definitely will not be considered for any full-time position, qualified for internships (but will be fighting for it against everyone else). Simply put, I think it‚Äôs rare for someone to be able to develop meaningful competencies in 1.5 years to be competitive in the job market.

Reason being that workplace experience is far more important than whatever the university teaches you. Especially when it comes to SUSS which does not necessarily offer the experience of a traditional university but is *IMO a degree factory (similar to Kaplan university) IMO* for working adults to obtain certifications hence the ‚Äúself-study‚Äù reputation it has.\n\nSo long as that degree fulfills that function (and seeing as you will save a significant amount of time at Kaplan granting you more time to advance your career), I feel that it is totally a logical option to choose Kaplan with the qualifier that the degree is recognized by your prospective employers which it should be for most private sector employers. \n\nCost should also be weighed into your decision though I think they should be about the same.', 'Suss because its a local uni and they make sure that u have experience overseas and compusory work attachment which makes it easier to find jobs in future', 'SIM , SUTD....better choice...Both SIM UOL or RMIT...very reputable...But SIM UOL is 100% exam based and some companies prefer UOL degrees.I have friends grade with UOL degree and working in the foreign bbank.But tough because is 100% examination based...', 'Definitely suss, its recognized as a local uni, can secure jobs faster', 'Choose a program from SIM or SUTD...', ""I have a friend of mine who only requires 8 months to graduate at SIM RMIT.

Also do the tys!!! I did it about 2 times, and attempt some prelim paper qns if u have time. I also redid my tutorials for the topics that i found more challenging \n\nCHEM: I summarized impt definitions/concepts/formulas for easy ref then memorized them, then I did the TYS twice! I also attempted other school prelim qns at the same time :) \n\nMATH: Do prelim papers/TYS/revision questions every week. Close to As I did about 1 full set of papers (paper 1 and paper 2) per week. Make sure to do under timed conditions if u r like me and can‚Äôt do math quickly ._.\n\nECONS: I summarized key concepts, explanations, and graphs into 1-4 page notes per chapter (A4 sized paper) then I started reading and memorizing them. I also redid my tutorials and analyzed essay answers. For graphs and diagrams, keep practicing drawing them repeatedly and they will get easier with time :-) Close to As I attempted 1-2 TYS CSQs and did detailed essay outlines for a few TYS essays each week. Do the practices without ref to ur notes under timed conditions and fill in the gaps afterwards so u can better rmbr the content. \n\n*side note: my chem and math weren‚Äôt too strong in sch, but I managed to do well in As so it could have been due to some luck HAHA (so my advice may not b v helpful for these subjects!)', 'Chem: make an organic chem mindmap! Connect all the functional groups together by their reactions (really helps for synthesis qns). Each reagent can have multiple reactions eg NaOH could be present in acid base, hydrolysis, nucleophilic sub etcetc. After prelims i didnt bother with prelim papers alr i just spam tys\n\nMath: i made small math notes on cue cards to rmb impt formulae. Spam tys and do 5qns of each topic ure weak at. Eg after i finish a tys i just pick 5 hard looking differential eqn qns from the topical book my sch gave me', 'Got 90 rp in PCME. Did zero note taking but it depends on your learning style as well. Personally did not find note taking to be an effective method.\n\nTips:\n1. Practice Practice PRACTICE! I was doing multiple prelim exam papers a day for the different subjects and checking through the answers correcting myself for Chemistry and Math which are very format and practice intensive. There is always a set format for dealing with Chem and Math questions that will come to you like breathing if you do enough practice.\n2. In econs memorize the different answering formats for Demand and Supply and Market Failure especially. It is a guaranteed way to get full marks for 2 out of the 3 essay qns you have to do. For Macro econs essay just choose one you are the most comfortable with but the format for Macro is more varied.\n3. If you have to do note taking, you should use an active format of note taking. Write down the questions that are relevant to the parts you‚Äôre highlighting and ask yourself those questions and recall the answers from memory', 'how do you manage ur note taking? like after each chapter ends? How long do u spent on it? And how much to note?

Tutorial and testpapers\n\nSome ppl could not pay attention in lecture and self study but idk i learn best through listening so i made sure to pay attention. \n\nFor chem, some of my friends worked better by hardcore memorising the notes PLUS writing their own notes but my memory was terrible so i did a mindmap once to look over what i needed to know and basically never referred to it again. Then ""memorised"" through just doing qns and test papers. \nIf you have a better memory and notes help you link concepts (which is super impt in chem) then do it!\n\nFor math i think everyone spams qns but what rlly helped for me was to try finding my mistakes myself.

Some will focus more on certain themes like Cold War and whatnot. Since JC is a stepping stone to uni, where there are no textbooks given to facilitate your own learning, you will have to take the step up to do so yourself, by borrowing relevant ref books and learning the content from there, if your lecture slides are not good enough or you can't understand them.\n\nMy advice would be to consult your teachers and ask them if they could explain it to you in a way that you would understand better if you're struggling in understanding the lecture notes. Personally, I found the lecture notes to be more condensed than what I found in ref books and hence easier to understand, but that's just me.

Some Tips - For maths, i assume most of pure is covered so you can start doing P1 of Prelim papers alr. For chemistry, its mainly organic now so might want to start learning OTOT using the notes that i provided or online one. Questions try practice using TYS. For physics, same thing try learn using lecture notes and practice with TYS. For economics, it depends, might want to start doing essay questions or even CSQ if Macro or Micro is already fully covered.

The amount of time you study is not a good indicator of how well prepared you are and how able you are to get an A1.\n\nFor subjects like math, science & POA I instead feel that a good gauge is finishing practice papers well before the timer ends and getting very high marks without checking for carelss mistakes, i.e E math paper 1 is 2 hours? Aim for almost full marks in 1 hour. Careless mistakes are weeded out with practice and a calm mental state (a must have for Os!) And by not checking through you'll immediately know which topics you're weak in!\n\nEnglish on the other hand... It's a tricky one, read model essays (and examples if u do argumentative) or read random descriptive words and have a vivid imagination if u do personal recount/descriptive essays. As for Paper 2, just keep grinding papers until u can get a high mark that is beyond the A grade to be safe.

Underline keywords and sentences to help you understand certain parts of the text, and if you have to expand on certain parts of the question (especially for essays), do it. No one is stopping you.\n\nNot only that, try reading up on various topics in the news, or if you're more adventurous, read up to gain further knowledge about the topics that really interest you on wikipedia, forums or blogs. You may never know what'll come out in your actual paper. This gives you content to use for your essays, in the form of examples and points.\n\nLastly, I feel that this may be underrated, but fortify your foundations on the technicalities of English. I know that using flowery and bombastic language ie. 'I serendipitously stumbled upon my long-lost cousin at the market yesterday.' can attract the eyes of Cambridge markers, but without a decent foundation in English, there's no use for a thesaurus. Study and know the rules of grammar, like which prepositions and tense to use by heart, such that it almost becomes like a reflex when you do editing questions. Try aiming for close to 0 grammatical errors for every essay you hand in to your English teacher. Only then can you try being a bit more creative and explorative with your writing style. \n\nIt may sound a bit daunting, but with practice, it is possible to achieve all of this.\n\nTl;dr: understanding of the text, reading up more widely, and strengthening your foundations are what will help you score your A1."", 'i agree with what the prev person said but here‚Äôs my number of hours (pls don‚Äôt use it as a reference for your studies)\n\na1 chem - 1 hour a day before Os (before Os, 10mins per day every weekday)\n\na1 emath - 1 hour per week of studying before Os, but did 1 paper per 1-3 days', ""The hours should not be your gauge though you need to allot time for each subject.  \n\nWhat you need to do first is prioritize your subjects.

For paper 1, you can prepare with the formats, many arguments and counter-arguments, but you can get a question that just simply stump you, and you can't explain them that well. This was what happened to me and I wrote  my worst essay (IMO) in the 3 years of writing either expository or argumentative.

The only way to get better is to drill yourself, until you can work at a speed that you can do it quickly and without mistakes. For my Amath and Emath, I just drilled papers. Finish one? Mark and check for mistakes, write the mistakes down if any somewhere and do the next one. Refer to your previous mistakes, treat it like a half open book test.

So here's a version for the more of arts subjs students.

I'm comfortable helping with History, Lit, Math and GP, also H3 Hist (technically we're not supposed to, but if you just want someone to bump ideas with on the direction of your paper, feel free to pm. Econs, man I can try but this is like 60% assurance, and much of it will be my speculation. 

The rest of the questions, esp like History essay question breakdown/analysis, it'd be nice to post here to make a whole stack! If you're shy you can pm, but I'll copy paste (lol cc) my reply to here.

Any other people who did arts subjs welcome to join :) I hope that even though there are no more MYEs for you all, and this coming moth of HBL, you will stay motivated and study steadily without burning out. This is such a new situation so honestly, can't blame you (and don't blame yourself!) for being anxious. Good luck!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fv71xg/a_levels_willing_to_try_and_help_if_people_on_hbl/,11.0,"['From a HELm:  just want to ask for study tips? \n\nHello! Wow okay, study tips are a very broad and general thing, but for the arts subjects, need memorisation, understanding and speed. \n\nFor history - make sure you analyse a lot of past year questions, get to know what question means what: ""to what extent"", ""do you agree"" ""evaluate"" ""was more important than"", all these have different nuances to the number of minimum points you have to write.\n\nFor history, I\'d say, uh, you can specialise but please, no spotting. (Cambridge threw us a Secgen question and first decade, then also no AFC) \n\nFor everything in general, I\'d say know what makes you motivated - for me, I like reading fiction, and watching dramas, then outdoors things I like to look at plants -> When I feel like I\'ve done enough work, then I relax to reward myself. This gives me something to look forward towards and makes studying less tough.  Also, try to do work consistently, don\'t spam papers because you can burn out, making you lose more time than if you just went slow and steady.  \n\nNext, I tried to clear all my content problems by mid of the year, talk to teachers, friends, re-read notes and relearn concepts if needed as early as possible. This is because if now, while practising you cannot do one topic then suddenly the panic sets in and you\'ll freeze up. Mark out beforehand the things you are not so good at, spend more time (eg . math OMG vectors please relearn it fast fast,) \n\nDo also remember to breathe. Yeah. Feels like a mad dash, but really a lot of things will be up to fate. Make sure you know your things all the way to the bottom. Understand the why and how, then in the future, any question can reapply your previous knowledge to.', ""From H1 lit student: Looking for suggestions on how to improve for lit, not sure how to be more familiar with content and constantly not having enough time during papers\n\nTo familiarise yourself with the content, the best possible thing you can do is read your texts often -> can't emphasise enough that even though we don't need to memorise, during the exam, flipping book to find the quote is one of the biggest time drains. \n\nI mean it's not going to be the end of the world :') but you really don't wanna have to flip flip your book like crazy during the actual A Levels. Still, I feel that the best sort of literature revision is just reading and re-reading your text. Unfortunately or not, h1 has fewer texts, so less to shuffle. I would rotate my texts, reading the ones in the same paper together in the same week. \n\nEsp for H2, your text comparison requires you to draw links between your texts, reading them back to back helps - do it until the point where you can imagine words in one text appearing in another in your dreams!\n\nAlso would advise not highlighting/underlining until you have a solid system in place, so you won't regret or have a messy book that you don't understand later on. Best time to do this is during June hols, all the way up to prelims!"", 'For h3 history, did your sch give u any tips on how to structure your essay? Am quite clueless HAHA', 'From \'need massive help for history H2\': Cannot do SBQ, especially part b tips\n\nOkay, for sbq, I think the most important thing to find out now is where your problem is: 1. Not enough ck 2. Not enough time/not writing fast enough. 3. Cannot understand the source/misinterpret (also important to note if you have more problems with which type -> the text chunks, cartoons, stats) 4. Not a \'rigorous\' analysis 5. Not enough skills shown? \n\nFor the ck side, one of the best things you can do is get exposed to a lot of sources - there are many things the sources can show us that the lecture notes may not get around to covering. The first thing to do is to get your hands on the school prelim paper drive (link is floating on Reddit I believe) if your teachers haven\'t given. Because the ck for the sources will only be a tiny bit of all the content that you are going to be learning. \n\nRigourous analysis means being able to go beyond just paraphrasing which is usually enough to pass as long as you write quick! One of the best skills for this is ironically not your CK, since when we do papers often sucks that the CK we want to use appears in a source inside the set they give us!! Instead, the best skill is the cross-reference. Because the skills only need to appear once/twice for you to move up the band (like from L4 to 5/6) you need to display as many skills as possible. \n\nBest to find sources that pair well (usually from the support set one will directly contradict the challenge set, or be an academic article about the exact same thing, etc lots of possible relationships) after you prove the reliability of the first half, cross-reference back to that one while writing about the next. Eg. A, B, C are reliable (finish) Then in the challenge set reliability evaluation \'Source E says ...."" CR to source A, which is an academic discussing the speech in source E, reveals to us that the political considerations of the speaker in E make it less reliable...\n\nAlso, just practise a bit!! more, need time to develop the flair and sometimes gotta get lucky and be hit by inspiration about the source - like not just \'academic source\' but \'this institute is actually funded by the government\' - not just \'retroactive analysis\' but \'the anniversary of the event\', not just \'after the cw so the archives will be opened\' but \'this is the person recanting their earlier statement because now they are no longer in power\' \n\nIf you know your part a is fine, when doing papers don\'t need to waste time, just jot down the similarity, difference, explanations, don\'t need to write out in full when doing prac. Only do the whole paper if you have time, or if you need to practice all.', ""More on help with lit paper time management:\n\nFor time management during lit paper, usually we try to go by 1 hour per question part -> but this actually can translate into 15 minutes of reading all the questions and planning at least a bit for all the questions you intend to write. \n\nThis is so that you have 5 mins per question at the very beginning as well as 5 mins just before you start writing to plan in-depth your topic points (with evidence/quotes cause sometimes you write then DANGIT cannot find your quote then ded need rewrite), before the 50 minutes of writing your essay. \n\nAlso idk how scientific it is, but I've always felt doing the beginning thinkythink helps me kickstart subconsciously thinking about the later questions, so I'm warmed up by the time I get there"", ""How to structure your study plans/More general study tips:\n\nHmm studying in general really depends on you. Want to just say that I did super bad for my promos (needed to take supp paper even), but I managed to make it by putting in consistent effort. So no matter how badly you did, there's hope okay!\n\nFirst look and rank your subjects, then in each subject rank the different topics - know where you are weak in, what content, what skills, and focus on those.\n\nWhen you get demotivated, then practice something that you know you are good at to boost your morale - the amount of time you will spend on each subject really depends on how much that subject needs help, relative to your other subjs, but I would say it's good to touch all your subjects every week\n\nBest not to leave things untouched (eg. don't mug econs until no time to touch history, or do so many math papers until you toh and don't wanna read econs notes) cause the subjects can become a 'different language'\n\nThis is particularly true for Arts kids like us, because even though all our subjects are essay based, the kind of writing History wants, versus Econs, versus Lit is very different! :') I think it's self-explanatory that if you're doing CSC, CSE, CLLit, ELLit, Geogh, that they are different writings. So, even if they are your best subjects, don't forget them -> in fact, use them as 'reward motivation'."", ""Tbh, not really! There was no fixed 'format', but like you just write stuff and then go to your teacher supervisor to have it looked over. However, you can write with reference to either samples that your supervisor shows, and according to the h3 history syllabus doc.

It's sometimes fascinating to find the little things that the paper is designed to do, especially the Learning Outcomes which did actually push me into thinking harder about my topic.\n\nThe most plain format I can think of is:\n\nIntroduction, \n\nLit review (expansion of the one you did briefly in the proposal), \n\n\\[start of content\\] -> maybe about two/three headers on points you are doing research, the multiple answers/facets to the historical question you created, \n\nconclusion (where you should be tying up any loose ends/synthesising as well as weaving in the limitations that you originally identified -> this good to link to a future possible avenue of research to show that your question itself doesn't just stop, but provides even more possibilities in understanding the historical context and motivations. \\[end of content\\]\n\nacknowledgements are always nice, I feel, \n\nand finally bibliography, and appendices. \n\nBut really, the actual wording and structure depend heavily on your topic. Background-problem-reaction (with analysis inside) would be the summary of my paper, I did a geopol topic. If like eg. my friend did socioeconomic/dev. or one senior did art (like drawing art stuff), your topic headers may be more of context-issue-key figures-controversy-public reaction stuff like that.\n\n If have more questions, can pm!

If you have picked up any interesting hobbies or activities, you can also include them in your portfolio, albeit not under the ""CCA"" section. It will help to show that you\'re a person with interests and you actually do your own stuff in your own time.  \n\nIn the meantime, I think it will be in your best interest to focus on your studies and ensure your solid GPA to maximise your chances of entering. When it comes to standard admissions, grades are still the most important.', 'Hello! Current final-year NTU engineering student here!\n\nJust like you, I was from an engineering course in NP too, and I didn‚Äôt take part in any CCAs during my 3 years. My graduating GPA was 3.7 and I managed to get into NTU, so I would say you don‚Äôt have to worry if you don‚Äôt join any CCAs.\n\nHowever, it would be good to have CCAs if you want to apply for scholarships during admissions. Also, I sort of regretted not having CCAs in poly because although I did have a lot of fun in poly studying what I loved with amazing friends, I wished I did more fun stuff outside of school, in school. \n\nThe transition from poly to uni is no joke, especially if you get into direct-entry to Year 2 (very likely in your case). You might not have time to enjoy your youth if you just keep focussing on your studies all the time. So my advice to you, work hard, play hard, cheesy as it is.\n\nAlso, if you‚Äôre wondering, after 3 years in poly not having a CCA, I made sure to take part in CCAs every semester of uni.', ""Ah i see....thanks for the information!

in the server , i wld be also creating channels for diff schs depending on who‚Äôs int in joining , so that you &amp;amp; ur batchmates have a platform to discuss abt ur hw etc. i‚Äôm doing this because some of you may find it difficult to ask ppl from generic platforms such as in sgexams as everyone is from diff schools &amp;amp; they might not be able to help you as some j1s might not have learnt the topics yet or j2s busy rushing past year papers HAHA. so it would be easier for y‚Äôall to discuss in the classified channels since y‚Äôall are more or less at the same pace !!

of course , you can also study alone but with the company of others by muting yourself !! do what works for you as long as you can keep ur momentum going !!

p.s. i‚Äôve been contemplating between discord , zoom, skype or google hangouts ,, chose discord in the end as i like discord the most HAHA (&amp;amp; i don‚Äôt really know how to use zoom oops) but if u have suggestions to improve this idea pls tell me HAHAH thanks alot !!

idk how well wld this work but imma just try ü§≠

[UNI] NTU PGPA + 2ND MAJOR IN BIZ????,University :snoo_smile:,1586013123.0,"Hi I got offered ntu PPGA. Thing is I want to also major in business. There have been similar qtns but I'm still confused plus I emailed the PPGA dept like the admissions officer told me to and I haven't gotten a reply yet :)))))

1. Can I take a second major in biz after my first year?
2. Does NTU differentiate double majors and second majors? Apparently in the former, both majors are equally heavy but in the latter, the secondary major is lighter in load?? So if I can actually take up a biz major later on tgt with ppga is it a double major or second major? 
3. Assuming I got to take biz with ppga, will I be able to get a job in either related industries? Or will biz just be seen as a value add to my PGPA major (since I still get a single degree) so I can most likely only pursue a career related to PGPA?

as i withdraw from jae and accepted my course in dae, the enrolment portal was opened again till end of march. i have accepted the course, submitted the compulsory documents, and done everything that was needed. when my laptop arrived, i tried to configure it, however im stuck at the very first step because they said my student id doesnt not exist in their database. so i emailed the admission office for help and i was told that the email would arrive on 30th March, and i should asked the IT department for help if i still have a problem. its been a few days and i have not received anything yet. so i sent two emails to both the admission office and the IT department regarding this issue. today i called the IT Department, and they told me the issue lies with the admission office. so they passed the message and i have decided to give the admission office a call on monday morning, and possibly head down to sch in the afternoon or the next day to speed up the process

for the past few weeks, a lot of rp students have received a sms telling them that they can apply for a concession card at transit link website. i again did not receive anything. when i tried entering my ic number into the online portal, transit link told me that my data was not found in their data base. i have also emailed rp admission office about this issue.

can i just check if anyone is in the same situation as me? or you have been in this situation before? is it possible that i might have been left out? i have a friend who was told that the admission office forgotten to send him an email for his dae interview, and he was supposed to receive the email by yesterday but nothing came.

[UNI] My SIT Kira Interview experience (Radiation Therapy),University :snoo_smile:,1585997059.0,"Hi! I have just completed my SIT Kira Interview. While the experience remains fresh in my brain, I have decided to post what I have went through in order to help people who are going for this soon.\*\* Before my interview, I read through a fellow person's post about the SIT Kira Interview experience. It was a very thorough post and helped me a lot so I **will not** be repeating what the person has mentioned.

* It was 18 questions for me. The first question was not a question because the system just needed you to place your ID (NRIC / Passport) next to your face and say your full name out loud.
* You **do not** need to be worried about the sound quality of the recording. If the sound quality is bad, the system actually knows. The system would ask you to redo the question immediately. (It was like that for me at least!)
* For point no.2, I finished the assessment at 12p.m. sharp today. At 2p.m., they emailed me to ask me to redo the first question. That was because they could not confirm my identity for some reason. So please do **check your email** even though you finished the test already. This is important especially for the people who are only going to do this right before the deadline.
* There were scenario based questions. Unlike what I expected, the scenario based questions were not based on events that would happen in the hospital. There were a total of **two scenarios** but **four questions.** Both questions were not based in a hospital setting. Both scenarios gave me a position in the community (e.g. Grassroots leader) and a random situation and wanted you to roleplay. You play two different characters in the two different scenarios.
* There were quite a feel **what would you do / how do you feel** questions. Apparently, they said in the question that they wanted to see how people deal with adverse situations and difficulties. For example, mine asked me how I would feel and what I would do if I failed an exam and my scholarship was going to be taken away. Additionally, I had ""financial difficulties"" and how I would react and how I felt about this.
* They actually do ask you what you would do if you do not succeed in getting into this course! (I was totally not prepared and probably screwed this up)
* I was not prepared but please think about **someone** who influenced you a lot in your life (link it to your course). OR An **event** that has influenced you a lot in your life.
* Lastly, I would like to encourage all of you to be careful when doing this test. I have realised that when writing the 30 minutes essay question and when you are preparing the answers to the questions, the green camera light for macbook is still on. I went to do some small research and found out that if the green camera light is still on, the camera is still on. I am actually **not sure** if they keep a recording of you preparing the answers to your questions, but I am just asking all of you to be as careful as possible! Don't do anything weird that you wouldn't actually do in a face to face interview ok! (If I am wrong about this please let me know because I actually sneezed in front of the camera accidentally hahaha)

I hope this might help someone along the way! All the best to you if you are going to do this interview soon!

Disclaimer - These are MY questions that I received. You might receive different ones and I will not be held liable if anything were to change or it feels like I short-changed you. Use these as a guide of the level of difficulty

1. What is creative accounting?
2. Why do you think it is important for accountants to upskill with the introduction of technology? (something like this-ish)
3. Do you think that RPA and AI will replace accounting jobs in the future?

Sorry I have like no gc left after A Levels but came across this question so I just give you general tips for this question:\n\ni) There are two parents, one at the back and one at front - and there are 7 remaining children. The order of the children matters, so you find the number of PERMUTATIONS of these 7, then multiply by two (because you can reverse the parent order for any of your permutations)\n\nii) You have 3 sisters, so you CHOOSE 1 of 3, and then consider the parentsisterparent group as one person for you to permute the new number of (2 sisters, parentsisterparent, 4 brothers) 7 people and finally also multiply by two (because again, can reverse parents order)\n\niii) Seats are indistinguishable means the seating in a circle formula (n-1)! or (n!)/n depending on which form you learn, they are the same -> basically, if they were in a line, you would do the n! but because the seats in indistinguishable, you divide by the n number of seats. \n\nThe 'no two brothers' makes you think of the slotting method, I found that drawing a circle with the number of seats helped me. So you have to 'fix' the position of the brothers, the 4 of them, and then you 'slot' the five remaining members in between them.

[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,:redditgold: MUST-READS: University :snoo_smile:,1585974513.0,"I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I‚Äôm not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (third choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don‚Äôt shame me, it‚Äôs fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there‚Äôs literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people‚Äôs portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler ‚Äì 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard ‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore‚Äôs/the world's best architectures and what makes them good.¬†Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‚Äòcan multiple hierarchies coexist?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?‚Äô and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question.¬†It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you‚Äôre trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‚Äòabstract‚Äô while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

[https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu](https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn‚Äôt want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‚Äòhm! Good enough‚Äô. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‚Äòis the first one from an anime?‚Äô and ‚Äòwas the third one a class assignment?‚Äô and ‚Äòwere the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?‚Äô (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‚Äòwhy do you want to study architecture?‚Äô and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn‚Äôt really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‚Äòso why is archi your third choice?‚Äô and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they‚Äôre applying for Uni.

[O levels] Am i too ambitious?,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585969892.0,"Hello, I'm sec 3 and I'm currently taking english, math, chinese, comb chem/phy, geog/ss, poa and fnn. I wouldn't say that I did well for all my subjects for WA1. I find that math, poa and fnn are the easiest for me to score a distinction but I'm not that good in my languages, I'm good in chemistry but I'm kind of struggling with physics which kind of frustrates me and honestly both my geog and ss teachers just can't teach (im sorry ;-;) I'm making my own notes for geog at the moment since my school doesn't give any notes for geog, and honestly I'm not sure what to study for ss other than just memorising the format. Im planning take amath (and maybe pure bio) as a
private candidate but I'm currently not doing well in amath, self studying amath apparently doesn't work well for me as I only know how to do the basic questions (sigh), I don't really want to turn to my math teacher for help either and my friends don't really have the time to help me as they are also busy. Pure Bio is not going so well either but I managed to do my school's paper and passed, should I start making my own simplified notes like geog?

Why do I want to take a math and pure bio?
Well it's because my aim is to go to a top tier jc and im planning to go to the science stream and I've seen that you require both pure science and a math. 

My aim is to get 6 points for o levels and I'm currently getting like 18..
Does anyone have a suggestion on what i should do? Should I just stick to my own subject combi or should I continue? Should I aim for something more realistic and just aim to go for a more easier to get in jc? I know being ambitious is good but I'm afraid that if I aim too high I might actually fall and be disappointed with the end result. The students in the better classes taking pure in my school aren't even aiming for something I'm aiming for.. 
I've told some of my friends about my aim, they don't seem to believe that I can do it either and my teachers don't seem to think I can even make it to a jc and told me to just go for a poly instead since its my level.. Am I being delusional?

I found that having a teacher explaining the basics to you really helps, so you should consider that, or look up some videos on the topic you‚Äôre working on on YouTube.\nAs for being too ambitious, I think it‚Äôs ok to aim high, and I‚Äôve heard that even the Sec 4 prelim results don‚Äôt determine your final result.

You can memorize content for GI from tb cause answers just come from there but try memorize other stuff from tb theres too much.

I‚Äôm currently a J2 and honestly though my school doesn‚Äôt have MCT (or those block tests most schools had during march), we did have lecture tests etc for around every 3 chapters for each subject.

They‚Äôre purely there to motivate you cuz if you physically see others studying you feel more motivated to study too. If you‚Äôre too shy to ask just search up ‚Äústudy with me‚Äù videos on YouTube, there are livestreams and 6-8 hour videos of ppl legitimately studying', 'hello! j2 here with science combi (physics). personally i have always preferred self-studying to lessons so heres my take on how to be productive with studying alone! some of these may be obvious but yea here goes:\n\n1. choose a good place in your house where you can sit and focus. have enough space for writing, a glass of water, and youre set. no need to be super neat (i am never)!\n\n2. listening or not listening to music is your choice, personally i find that on some days for some tasks the ""demand"" for music is different. when you are trying to learn new content or use your brain heavily (e.g. for math), i think no music is more likely to work better. but this is your personal preference! take some time to figure out what you need\n\n3. if there are videos, it is not necessary to watch them. coming from someone who has not watched a single tutorial/lecture video from my school (for any of my subjects), i find that it can be very slow to watch videos and learn, also easier to get distracted. instead, try to read the notes independently and attempt the examples. if you really need solutions to guide you through and there is no pdf solution (reading is definitely faster than watching), you dont have to watch the whole video! just speed to where the whole solution is, copy it down, and figure out independently why it works this way. this helps long term understanding than just watching and copying ! (ithink)\n\n4. dont wait to ask! at any instance where you are stuck on one question and have been thinking about it for a while, that is the best time to ask your friends or teachers for help! when the problem is fresh in your mind and you have thought about it, that is the best time to look at the solution and it is a lot easier to internalise what others teach you then. if you decide to put the question off, not only will you have to relook at it when you next ask, but you would not be fresh with all your thoughts when you receive an answer, which is less effective for learning.\n\n5. discipline! you dont have to study everyday for ten hours if you dont feel like it, in fact dont study when you dont feel like it. (without school i sleep for twelve hours a day and study for any amount of time between zero to ten hours inclusive, and hey im doing fine in school, so dont stress about not studying ""enough hours""-- theres no such thing!) i mean discipline as in you maintain focus and productivity when you decide to study, and dont let yourself off until youre done with your tasks. no matter how fed up you are about it, keep yourself there until you finish it, and you can relax better afterwards.\n\n6. working smart is better than working hard, take this time to try things out and work out a way which works best for you. for the two months before a levels, youll probably have to spend lots of time studying on your own, so its good to start trying now!\n\njiayous !! you can do this (:', 'For me, I just take out my water bottle and leave it on my table.

Would like to hear some suggestions on what kind of financial aid can I receive so that I do not have to pay that much. Or if there is any other alternative route in taking art teaching.

If you do that part well, you‚Äôll be offered art teaching fully subsidised by MOE for the course duration otherwise it‚Äôs the regular payment\n\nIf you‚Äôre singaporean who‚Äôs overall family income might be staggering a bit, you‚Äôll be eligible for MOE bursary which would cover about half the cost ($1-2k+). \n\nOther option is to get scholarships. Can only get 1 once a year. The school isn‚Äôt very competitive and getting one in my opinion is not difficult if you top your own class. They cover 1 year worth of tuition fees which is darn good knowing that you‚Äôd still spend hundreds for art materials. Min 3.8 gpa score for 1 semester and overall 3.5+ cgpa to get one based from my experience.\n\nFortunately, the other route to art teaching is to directly enter NIE. I‚Äôm not sure about entry but while I was at the NTU gallery for art teaching, I talked to a mother tongue teacher who switched to teaching art so maybe that possible? \n\nHope this gives you some idea to plan financially', 'The fully subsidised cost is when you sign up a bond of 5 years with MOE right? It seems like applying through NAFA and applying through MOE is diff given that their application dates are diff.. I do not want to be bonded but is that the only option to avoid paying full fees of a whopping 19k?', 'The thing is applying with MOE actually lets you have the qualification to teach in schools unless that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want because the whole point of art teaching is to teach at schools. But not everybody gets it you know, only the best art students can get the fully subsidised option. An ‚ÄòA‚Äô for O levels might not even let you pass the MOE interview. They used to combine the interview with MOE but I think a change of system happened. I really think the bond is a super good option to secure a good job that lets you teach at secondary/JC after a couple years of experience. NAFA sadly has no follow up degree course for art teaching also.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to teach art classes outside, you can do that but it is not advisable in my opinion. Other diploma like fine arts and arts management can do the same. The students on their internships did teach children. There‚Äôs a thing with pay differences in the industry and the students were getting paid peanuts during their internship. If you‚Äôre going to cover cost with awards, you‚Äôd have to fight these people for the awards since they‚Äôre talented.\n\nAnd lastly I‚Äôm not going to suggest working part time. You can‚Äôt do that at NAFA. Absolutely not. Best option, study study study and sign up for the annual awards', 'Hey! Thank you so much for the well thought out reply it is very insightful. May I know how should I start building up my portfolio then? What kind of artworks should I showcase during the interview in order to get in? Also, will they decide to fully subsidised school fees right after the interview process or they still need to see my performance throughout my 4 years of studies?', 'Also, the NAFA application is until May 2020 but the MOE scheme side says that their JAE has already ended. Does this mean that I have to wait until next year to apply?', 'Well my friend that did the interview was good at oil painting and charcoal drawings but got rejected. Had a feeling it was the discussion that wasn‚Äôt good. Instead, she just got the scholarship and did fine arts. She did receive the non-subsidised offer but no point since she wanted to teach at schools. The art medium for the portfolio has to be somewhat basic. Oil paining, charcoal, pencil sketches, acrylic painting, clay sculpting (much less) etc stuff suitable to be taught at school. Definitely start your portfolio immediately but pace yourself so the work looks good.\n\nThey‚Äôll immediately let you know after the interview results.

[A Levels] should i drop out because of covid-19?,A Levels :snoo:,1585921668.0,"
im not ready. it‚Äôs fucking terrifying. 


i took BCME in my first year, then switched to HELM. i don‚Äôt regret the change despite not taking most of the arts subjects, in fact im doing much better. in j1 i was doing fine with 60 rank points (average A B Cs) and i thought i was finally on the right track with matching aptitude in the arts, maybe 2020 would be my year? 

well .. apparently not. IF i had graduated w my batch i could‚Äôve avoided this whole situation. due to covid: all subject teachers have closed consultations, even online chats like zoom are limited to 15 minutes bc my lit teacher has a 7 year old in the house. 

i didnt expect this at all.

my results have also all dropped and im hovering around S es despite so much hard work. especially h2 history and h2 lit.

ASR hasnt given ONE sample essay for history, and for h2 lit i really dont know where to start. 

these are my books: p1 (TGG, playing for time) and p3 (woman in mind, virginia woolf, regeneration)

i shouldve known ASR wasn‚Äôt a arts niche school, hell, we have one lit teacher for the whole h2 cohort. (p1) i hear of other schools getting so much resources but asr hardly gives any. we dont have homework every week aside from the occasional paragraph.

its been almost 2 years, we‚Äôre supposed to be gearing up for As but its just not happening. maybe im the only one feeling this? 

im studied hard, went in ASR with 9 points but my school really has to step it up on their lit department. there is no structure and every lesson feels like im being cheated of my grades. i keep trying to write essays for my teachers but they just keep putting me off. dont know what to do honestly üò≠üò≠üò≠ ive already wasted one year and i just want to get my grades. its really tough being a repeat bc theres so much pressure and stress that you have to do well. im pretty healthy mentally but the waves of anxiety are really making me sick


Edit: 

Thank you!!! I‚Äôll work to overcome the odds, beat the weight of anxiety attacks that makes me feel like im spiraling out of control, and that fucking crazy mounting pressure.

[A Levels] HBL is probably gonna make me rot at home,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585912263.0,"JC has been pretty hard on me. 

When I first stepped into JC, I was pretty stressed about a bunch of stuff, such as my choice for subject combi and cca. After that was settled, I began stressing out on my academics. I took combined science in o levels and have taken up 2 h2 science subjects in JC. I became stressed from the big jump in difficulty and depth of the topics, and there were stuff that was only taught in pure science that the lecturers assumed we knew about and I had to figure that out myself. 

But one of the reasons I am still persevering on is my friends in my og and class. They've been making JC life way more bearable and enjoyable and I always knew that they were also in the same boat. 

However, because of HBL today, I hadn't had any interactions with them, besides them asking about HBL matters. Moreover, I am a peripheral member of a clique I am in now, and I only talk to them at school and they'd normally do stuff like facetime without me (they're actually really nice ppl and I have nothing against them, I just haven't reached that level of closeness in my friendships with them compared to them with one another, don't misinterpret it as exclusion). 

And often times when I'm alone, a lot of negative and insecure feelings would cloud my thoughts and I'd often mumble deprecating things about myself. And given that HBL will start daily from next week, I have become worried about my mental wellness as I'd probably have very little interaction with my friends. There have been articles about how cases of mental health issues in people have spiked on the first day of lockdown in the UK, and I'm worried that my mental health will further deteriorate after the full HBL has been implemented. 

I don't need anyone's pity or sympathy or anything like that, because I just wanted to vent out my feelings. As much as I want to be closer to my friends at school and want to do all those close friends would do, I probably won't be able to because tbh I haven't really done that with my friends in pri or sec sch, what makes me think I can have such close friendships in JC life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu6j1i/a_levels_hbl_is_probably_gonna_make_me_rot_at_home/,41.0,"['take the first step and ask to skype or sth!! it may seem really daunting but its really worth it!! maybe theres other peripheral members in your clique too haha then yall can be close together.. if not just ask the entire group? you said that they are nice so they probs wont reject u and facetime between themselves (maybe they just think you wouldnt care to facetime them cus yall not close)', ""You can do it bro!!!

[A Levels] Senior's Advice,A Levels :snoo:,1585909944.0,"Hi! In light of this whole HBL thing, I want to offer some advice taken from what I went through. I'm a senior who took A levels last year. One thing that's vv important to note is please don't get carried away and slack. In my J2 year, I took things free and easy even up till June holidays, then I realised I had much less time than I thought I did. (As in, I didn't study during June at all.) 

Yes, for those of you who are struggling in school for personal reasons or anything and are really happy about being able to ""take a break"", go ahead. Take the time to recharge. In fact, I do advise that everyone should relax. This is to prevent burning out. 

But do also continue to keep up with the syllabus and start your revision! I heard that mid year might be affected... as in cancelled. If this really comes to pass, it would mean that you'll only know how much you know at prelims. You don't want to go into prelims getting straight U's. By then, it'll be pretty hard to do well due to the time constraint.

Many people do not have the self-discipline to keep up with their studies even as they are attending school (not taking initiative to clarify doubts with the teacher etc, not doing homework, not listening in lecture). Fewer will have the self-discipline to bother with their studies in this season of quarantine. But remember that consequences await for whatever choices you make. I know quite a lot of people from different JCs who didn't do well (some are retaking right now). I also have friends who U-turned (drop to J1 during A levels) because they felt they weren't prepared enough. Not doing well for A levels is a very real reality for everyone. The reason will differ for everyone but do you really want your reason to be because you didn't study hard enough?

Eventually, many people do come around to trying hard when the A levels near. Sometimes, it's when they see their mid years. Other times, it's when they see their prelims. In this context, there may not even be a mid year exam and to wait for prelims would already be too late. My friend U-turned 30 days before A levels. He gave up before he even took the exam. A levels is a mental war and you don't want to have a self defeatist attitude and worse, it's justified because you KNOW you didn't study hard enough. My point is, there comes a time when there's a point of no return. Now is probably not that time yet. But that time always comes without us knowing.

By all means, take your breaks. Enjoy your hobbies. Spend time with your family. But don't use this quarantine season to run away from what you fear because problems aren't solved that way.

Support is also pretty important! You should probably continue to keep in touch with your classmates and friends because even if you aren't close to them/don't like them, you guys are still going through the same thing and it helps to not feel alone. If you don't mind, you can also talk to your teachers as well! You should probably talk to them about how you can complement your own learning.

PS: I probably sound pretty harsh because I'm the idiot who slacked and I know more people who are disappointed with their grades than people who are happy with them. And I know many people who are lazing around despite saying ""oh, I want to be doctor"" and it just doesn't sit well with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu622b/a_levels_seniors_advice/,31.0,"['i second op‚Äôs post i slacked till june too and paid the price when my myes were so shit had to work rlly hard to get back on track sometimes i will wonder how things will be different if i hadn‚Äôt slacked', 'Hehe thank you for the wise words!!

Never be complacent, always be prepared

There were signed petition for school closures.

Every student and teacher had a chance to go through Home based learning. Loaned out many laptops and WiFi to students who don't have. The exercise this week went smoothly. 

It is now time to move to full home based learning. 
From Wednesday, 8 April onwards, Home based learning until 4th May. 

Required to stay at home. 

School remains open to those who need support.

Exams: Do away for all mid year school exams. National exams are still essential and will continue.

O level MT exams will proceed. Year end exams no need to worry for now.

Marking will be adjusted to be more lenient and can apply special consideration. 

Student Care: Remain open for parents who need support with all the health measures in place, thermometer and etc.

Uni: All exam and homework assignment at home

Poly and ITE: New batch of students, first years, come to campus, register and get equipped for online learning. Students will be coming in small separate batches for the next few weeks. 

Advice: Try to learn outside of syllabus, find the curiousity in you and learn what you are interested in during this time (lol)

Stay safe, stay home, stay curious.

[O Levels] Scoring straight A1s in Secondary English and N/O Level English -- Paper 4 Oral edition,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585900214.0,"In this discourse today, I will be sharing some tips and tricks to study and prepare for N/O Level English Oral. Often, students are at a loss and do not know where to place their focus on for English Oral. As such, they often go into the exam with barely any preparation. In 2020, the syllabus for English Oral has changed -- information is now presented in a video format instead of a singular picture. Furthermore, many students are worried because the oral exam has been postponed as well. However, with the correct preparation technique, I believe that English Oral is an accessible component for students to score well in.

1. **When your preparation time starts**

10 minutes is not a lot of time, if I do say so myself. However, it is sufficient time to prepare for both sections if the time is managed well. Usually, I will allocate 3 minutes for the passage preparation. Read through once, and sift out the areas that emphasis has to be placed on. Don't dwell on the passage for too long as you will require more time to brainstorm for the spoken interaction. Watch the video very closely. 2-3 times would be advisable, and take note of every single detail. After watching the video, immediately start to brainstorm on your ideas and key points. More explanation on preparation for this part can be found below under spoken interaction so i will not delve into it here. 

**2. Reading Aloud**

""You can't prepare for reading aloud. Just go in and read the passage."" This is a common misconception that many students have. Due to our overuse of Singlish and sometimes, lousy English teachers \*cough\*, we get overly accustomed to pronouncing a certain word in a certain way. Fluency of reading is not difficult, hence examiners often pay extra close attention to the candidate's word pronunciation. Let's start with the most commonly used word, 'the'. If the immediate word following 'the' is a vowel (meaning AEIOU), 'the' is pronounced as 'thee'. However, if the following word is not a vowel, 'the' is pronounced as 'th-uh'. This is just one of the multitude of pronunciation errors that students make in the examination. To prepare for reading aloud, make a habit of searching up a BRITISH DICTIONARY (not American!!!) for the pronunciation of any word that you may be unsure of. I can't be listing down every single word here, but try to make a compilation of commonly mispronounced words and practice reading them out loud individually, then in a sentence. When reading, aim to make the words flow. Don't just look at the word that comes right after, look at the rest of the sentence that follows a particular word. This can make a difference especially when you have to decide which word to place more emphasis and stress on. You may think that it is a little too late to say this, but try to incorporate accurate word pronunciations into your everyday conversations. Correct your family members and friends when they pronounce a word inaccurately. It is the little habits that we can correct to make ourselves more proficient at the language. Another important thing to take note of is articulation. Pronounce all 'th' 't' 'k' well, reading each word slowly. DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PASSAGE. Be careful when pronouncing words like 'tests'. Articulation will come easier when the passage is read slowly, but be careful not to undermine the areas of the passage that require emphasis.

3. **Spoken Interaction**

Students' biggest fear. The key to this section of the examination, as many students don't realise, is to let yourself go and just speak. Even if you are shaking with nerves on the inside (i was too, don't worry), just calm your outer appearance and pretend like everything is fine and dandy. There are ways to prepare yourself so you can be much less nervous on the day of the examination. If we were to take a look at the ALL the topics Cambridge could EVER come out with for an oral examination, how many are there? If we narrow it down into broad categories to ease our preparation, I can only come out with a handful. Technology, Arts and Culture, Family, Money, Transportation, Health, Ageing Population, Education. These are practically the only few broad categories that they could ever test you on. So based on these broad topics, prepare a handbook of recent news articles and stories. Take a look at the 2019 O Level English Oral. They combined technology and education, asking about the use of computers for education. From here, you can start doing some research and reading up on how technology has influenced education in recent years. You could even bring up how tuition centres and schools have been using online platforms to teach during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Or talk about the regular Home Based Learning days that schools usually implement occasionally. With sufficient examples prepared, you can then move on to weighing the pros and cons of using these means. e.g. ""Yes, these online learning platforms are beneficial as they facilitate independent learning, training students to be more self disciplined to complete their tasks without having to go to school. However, it can be detrimental as the lack of supervision could result in students slacking off, procrastinating more, and may not be effective in educating them."" You could also talk about how technology is expensive, and students from lower-income households may not have the means to purchase a personal laptop for their studies, especially when there are multiple children in the same household. By drawing out a mental mind map of this thought-flow process, you will be able to, with practice, come out with points very quickly. With more practice, you will get the gist of the kind of possible questions you may be asked in the examination based on these broad categories itself.

Another method I found extremely effective is to hold conversations with people. I often converse with my mother, asking questions like ""What do you think of the government imposing a sugar tax on food and beverages with high sugar content?"" Conversing with others will help you widen the viewpoint and expand your horizons, giving you more alternate perspectives to a certain topic. This is especially helpful for those who have difficulty coming up with points to talk about. Garner as many different opinions as possible, so you will have an array of ideas at your fingertips.

Lastly, I must emphasise this. Good use of vocabulary is extremely paramount in spoken interaction. It adds colour to the point you are trying to bring across. I have mentioned how to improve your command of vocabulary in my previous post for paper 1, so I won't delve into it further here. However, an extra tip for English oral would be to come out with key helping phrases for yourself. For instance, one phrase to describe transportation would be that it 'forms the backbone of every nation'. With these key phrases, it will be easier to actively recall some possible points to answer whatever question the examiner asks. 

be calm and stay confident in yourself! don't let your nervousness get the better of you and just remember to articulate well in the examination! feel free to ask anymore questions that you might have and I will try my best to answer them as soon as possible. :"")",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu46ns/o_levels_scoring_straight_a1s_in_secondary/,19.0,"['thank you!! you have any tips for summary ? thanks:)', 'henlo!! this was super super helpful, thank you :‚Äù) is it alright for you to  make a HCL edition?', 'There are four lights!', 'yess!! i will cover when i do the paper 2 section :‚Äù)', 'ok to be very honest you can consult me on every subject that i‚Äôve taken except hcl because i‚Äôve not scored well enough to give advice HAHAH', 'im a little confused what lights HAHA', 'ohh that‚Äôs fine!!!

[UNI]Can a private A level student(no JC background)have a chance to get into Cambridge/oxford/other good unis?,University :snoo_smile:,1585888533.0,"Serious answers please. I wanted to go to a top uni because I felt my family looked down on me and also I feel the education there is better. Also I feel jobs would hire you more if you were from a good uni.
 I want to study education/drama. (Yes I know NIE is an option but I do not want to be a school teacher. I want to do something different.) I spent the last 3 years working in a student care and loved it. Now I want to take private a levels this year. Brand new.
I came from Poly but my GPA was 2.85. 24F this year. I am a linguistic person and like humanities. But due to some family problems my grades suffered from O level till poly. For O levels I scored A2 for English and B4 for Combined humanities. Yes, I know it's not stellar. But I'm older now and I am more focused. Another plus point is i can pick the subjects I'm strong in. Problem is....I know it's competitive. You have Raffles and other top JC students all competing. And I'm just a private candidate. And I feel quite old already. So question is, should I take this route?  Because i know I'll study hard. I'm just afraid I'll be discriminated against because I'm not from some top JC or even in a school. If not my other option is LaSalle Musical theatre because I hope to be a performer or a drama teacher next time. The other more ""practical"" (but not that passionate) option would be SIM BA communication/international relations.
 
Also I heard of some taking 4 H2s to be more desirable. I'm intending to take H2: Geog, Lit and Econs. (Maybe Bio). A question I have is do I have to take H1 Math, Chinese and GP? If l am aiming for overseas, i heard it's not needed. 
If you have feedback please let me know your thoughts. As you know I'm not from JC and can't seek help from teachers about this. Would appreciate any opinion on the choice I'm making. Edit: I'm thankful for the feedback I'm receiving. I do not mean to sound ignorant or naive. I hope you understand I'm just really trying to find my way too. It hasn't been easy. I have depression and anxiety and only with difficulty recently managed to get my feet back on.  Despite my age where I feel like I must have everything figured out, I don't. And I'm scared that I'll make the wrong choice, whether it's (childishly) trying to gain my parent's approval or doing the things I love, or doing things for the money.

Yes, you have the drive and interest, but can you afford it? At 24, you\'re pretty much a grown adult. Can you afford, and I\'m not talking about monetary aspects, to put your life on pause to attend uni for 3-5 yrs? By that time, you\'ll be 29. 29 with a fresh uni degree, are you still job competitive? \nNot to be mean also but if your GPA and O Lvl results were like this, it\'s not likely to enter a ""top uni"" given that other institutions are more academically-driven. Its not about competing against Raffles or other schools, it\'s about even being good enough to get a distinction for a paper by yourself.', 'Hi, this is not meant to put you down, just a reality check if you do decide to take this route. Apart from what everyone else said, JC subjects are challenging to study and get straight A‚Äôs for even for students from top tier JCs. Even in those schools not everyone takes 4H2s. People who score 6 points raw in Olevels or IP students from top tier secondary schools still study for whole days with teachers‚Äô guidance and school resources and might not even get straight A‚Äôs. JC subjects are nothing like Olevel subjects (Olevel subjects barely scratch the surface, even more so if you got a B4 in combined humanities and want to take h2 geog in JC) and they‚Äôll be even tougher if you have no guidance at all and have not been in the habit of studying in a long time. It‚Äôs not the type of content you can just memorize like Olevels, you have to really understand everything very well especially if you want straight A‚Äôs. Idk if you know this but amongst JC students, Geog and Bio together is considered a suicide combination because they are both the most content heavy by far and by that I mean stacks and stacks of lecture notes that you have to memorize, internalize and apply. And practical is 20% of science subjects so keep in mind you have to know how to do them well for Bio. I apologize if this sounds mean, but when you say you are certain you will study hard and you are more focused now, it‚Äôs really easier said than done if you don‚Äôt grasp how rigorous the JC curriculum is and if your GPA and Olevel results were mediocre.

But it's extremely hard to get through the entire process even with resources + mock exams that schools give you. I'm speaking from experience bc I absolutely hated the process of honing myself to be good at exams.

[poly] i am so clueless and worried about poly lol,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585845091.0,"hi so yeah nyp orientation is cancelled and honestly it's been bugging me. im definitely not a social person but i was sort of looking forward to it. i know im not the only one to feel like im gonna be completely lost and dont know what to do. i thought the orientation would help make friends and get to know the school better plus get more insight about how tertiary education is like but i mean i guess not now. when the jcs had their orientation my friends were posting so much about it and it seemed fun like wow i want that too. it's been worrying me, like i have no idea what to expect at all, i dont even know how things work since i know it's nothing like secondary school. so if there's no orientation, then are they gonna just start classes immediately or something? and the fact that i dont know anything that is going to happen in the first week or day is making me worry even more. like they say check ur emails for updates but there's nothing. poly is starting in 2 weeks and i have no clue what to expect. there's also no cca fair anymore, so like, do we not get any introduction to it anymore? saw on the instagram story that time when they had a q&a, said that we sign up for ccas through the website but that's it? like what if i have questions? i know they have a description in the website but i sort of feel it isn't enough. and so is it something they will talk about especially since ccas aren't a focus in poly now? they say that ""orientation is online"" whatever that means and they provided a bunch of things to read up on but it's still doesn't feel comforting enough??  still feel like i dont know anything at all and am quite worried about this. i mean i understand given the covid situation that they decided to cancel orientation but it doesn't reassure me at all in fact it's tormenting my brain every once in a while. i still think they should have at least one day of it in small groups or something rather than cancel it completely, or at least explain everything in a long essay or list of things that will be covered, i wouldn't mind reading it, not just their website for me to read with so many tabs and parts to it like what if i miss something out? and i feel like the website is still not enough for me to feel reassured. am i the one expecting too much?  i dont know how some people are so chill or maybe im the one overreacting. i honestly DONT KNOW maybe it's just me because i feel like im the only one. everyone i know sounds so chill about it it's like they don't care. i dont even know what this is i just had to put it out somewhere dont attack me pls thanks k bye have a good day and wash ur hands

[O Levels] Scoring Straight A1s for Secondary English and O Level English-- Paper 1 edition,:redditgold: MUST-READS: O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585837295.0,"In this discourse today, i would like to share my tips and tricks on scoring well in O Level english paper 1. I have seen many posts about students struggling with english, and ultimately not scoring as well as expected in N/O levels just because of a low english grade.

As everyone knows, english is a compulsory subject taken into account in all grading systems -- EMB3, L1R4, L1R5, EL1B2R2 etc. Because of this, i just wanted to say that Cambridge will make the english paper accessible for everyone. Accessible, by no means easy, nor difficult. The paper is structured  in a way which helps to maximise students' grades for the subject itself.

**Paper 1**

1. **General Preparation Tips**

Firstly, I would like to emphasise a point that many often overlook. How many points have you lost due to carelessness, especially because of poor grammar? PLEASE CHECK YOUR WORK. The english paper 1 is structured in a way that gives you sufficient time to reread your essays to correct these mistakes. Minimising these mistakes can actually help you see an increase in grades.

Secondly, reading plays a huge, if not the biggest, part of paper 1 prep. The common question would be: "" what kind of content should i be consuming?"" Let's be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don't think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question. Something that i find extremely helpful are the Beyond Horizons magazines. i'm not sure if these are ordered in all schools, but if you have the means to, the subscription is worth spending the money on. The magazine offers an array of content -- from day-to-day experiences and stories, to tips and tricks for writing, and even comprehension and editing exercises. They offer fantastic reads in each volume and can definitely help in writing. Reader's Digest is also excellent in the content they provide. The topics discussed definitely struck a chord with me, and in turn offered me inspiration to manifest my thoughts and opinions in my writing.  Apart from these two series, keeping up with current affairs is also paramount to aid with coming up with content and examples in writing.

Thirdly, vocabulary. Vomiting all the vocabulary that you know is useful ONLY IF you use the words aptly. Certain words have nuances that we often overlook, causing the word to be inappropriately used in a certain situation, resulting in deduction of points due to 'WW' -- 'Wrong Word'. I personally don't have the superb power to come out with an unbelievably touching story or discussion that will move the marker to tears. Hence i depended on vocabulary a lot. I was so desperate to use as much vocab as possible in my writing, that i compiled a huge list of vocab words and their meanings, and crammed my brain with as many as possible for me to use in my writing. Learning vocabulary depends on how much effort you are willing to put in OVER TIME . It cannot be done a week before the english exam. So, if you are preparing for O/N Levels 2020, PLEASE START NOW. 

2.  **Editing**

The easiest section of the entire english paper. It's basically a free 10 mark section. The tricks are simple -- identify the keywords that will help you determine the faulty parts of the sentence. Setters always like to hide the mistakes at the end of a line, or the beginning of a line. Read well. The mistakes are not as difficult to spot once you have a grip of what's going on in the passage. That being said, do NOT rush into circling the mistakes immediately. Go through the passage once first, identify if it is in past, present or future tense, then proceed with attempting the questions. Nothing much to be said about editing, just be very careful as to not make careless mistakes. 

3. **Situational Writing**

Be very clear about the formats. Commit the differences in formal vs informal, email vs letter, news article, speech, to memory. You do not want to lose any marks because of wrong format. Next, annotate the question given. Take note of your Purpose, Audience and Context. These are all defining factors on how you should sculpt your writing. Make sure that you are clear of the question requirements. Break the requirements down, assigning them a paragraph each. After writing, make sure that your piece has met all the requirements (task fulfilment). One thing that many struggle with is keeping the tone. While writing, you have to consciously remind yourself to take note of the tone of your writing. If you are writing to a senior teacher, for instance, be very aware of the level of his/her seniority and sculpt your piece carefully. One more thing -- DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER. Only give yourself 45 minutes, capped at 50. You need much more time to plan your essay, so do not dwell on situational writing for too long. 

4. **Essay writing**

My favourite part of english. To begin, if you have ever been told to just focus on the style you're good at, please throw that advice out of the window right away. Cambridge is unpredictable. You could be fantastic at writing expository essays, but all it takes is one difficult and abstract topic to come out and you could be screwed over right away. Hence it is important to be versatile in your writing skills. While it is important to hone your skills in expository essays as they are more likely to be applicable in the future, it is equally important to be well-versed in the skills of writing descriptive, personal reflection and recount essays. The first step to attempting an essay of sorts is to come out with a detailed plan. Underline keywords, identify the important bits of the question, find out how you should elaborate on each content paragraph. Planning is an important step that many often overlook as they find it unnecessary. Having a plan will give you a clear idea of which direction to steer your story in. 

I will further break essay writing down into 2 parts, namely expository writing and narrative essays. 

For expository writing, start off by making the marker want to read your story. Make it intriguing. Draw the reader in and capture their attention from the very start. Personally, i am more well versed in descriptive writing, but i enjoy writing expository essays more. Hence, I often start off my expository essays with an anecdote. An anecdote is a short story, or an episode. By drawing in a personal example of your own, or creating a short but intriguing story, you will be able to effectively interest the reader right from the start. You can also start off with a hook, a quote, or a popular saying -- there are a multitude of story starters you could use. In your planning step for expository essays, you must prepare your points for your content paragraphs. This way, you can expound on each point once you reach that paragraph, facilitating a smoother thought process and flow in your writing. In a discursive essay, you should ideally have about 3-4 content paragraphs, while in an argumentative piece, you can have 2-3 points which are 'for' the statement, and one content paragraph for a rebuttal. I will not delve into how to write each paragraph. However, what i would like to touch on is the usage of examples in expository essays. Whatever you do, DO NOT USE THEORETICAL EXAMPLES. An example of a theoretical example is ""If a man uphold his rights and beliefs..."" Do not do this. Always have fresh and upcoming examples at the tips of your fingers. This is where the importance of reading comes in handy. You do not need to memorise statistics, but you need to provide a clear explanation which showcases your understanding of the example you have raised. At the very end of your essay, remember to balance out your points and give a conclusion that does not specifically point to one view, but instead sums up the points in the essay and give an equal weightage to each of the points raised in the content paragraphs. 

Most of the time, students avoid narrative essays. Personally, I would also choose to write an expository essay over a narrative essay. However, narrative essays reduce the likelihood of writing off-topic, which can cost you many marks. There is much less to unpack in a narrative essay question, as they usually ask you to ""write about a time..."", which involves some personal experiences to be brought in. It is easier to hit the content marks for narrative essays, so long as you meet the question requirements. However, in order to write a good narrative essay, lots of description has to be brought in. Think 5W1H. Producing a good narrative essay piece that 1) isn't too boring and 2) doesn't sound like a primary schooler's essay can be challenging. This is also where a good command of vocabulary comes in handy. To be able to visualise the scenario you are writing about is also paramount in ensuring that the reader gets the clearest idea that you are trying to bring across. When writing an essay on personal recount or personal reflection, remembering to bring across your feelings will help express the story better, making it less dry and unappetising. Keywords in narrative essay questions are also extremely important. Students must be aware if the question is asking for one instance, or for multiple episodes. Many students often miss this out, resulting in undesired content marks. Remember to conclude the story well and do not leave it hanging.

Seeing as how they are easy to forget', ""Can you create one for comprehension If you have the time? I think the biggest hurdle in English is comprehension because theres no clear way to do well other than practice, practice, practice and knowing format of questions. I agree practice is important, but it seems like bs that that's all u can do"", 'ü•∫ü•∫THANK YOU', 'HAHA I\'ve been considering writing one of these in my spare time but it seems you got to it before me! I have to say that it\'s very nicely written and am sure it will prove to be of good help to many in the near future. With that said, I\'d like to expand more on narrative essays since that was my focus during O\'s.\n\nDisclaimer: I\'ve noticed that Singaporean students tend to favour the expository/argumentative essays over narrative essays, so perhaps this is me pandering to a niche audience? I do, however, think that writing a good narrative essay can be picked up. The ability to manipulate and utilise the liberties of language will serve one well even into the future, especially during GP if the student so chooses to follow the JC route.\n\n# The Narrative Essay:\n\nBefore beginning to write a response to narrative essay types (henceforth referred to as \'NE\'), one must first *read the question*. It is a no-brainer, but many tend to overlook certain words or question requirements (e.g. A funny thing your *friend* did, A time you were *disappointed after being heavily expectant* for an event, A *person* you *admire*...).\n\nMany NE questions are conditional and the student must fulfil the first condition before proceeding to answer the question.\n\n**Content-wise:**\n\n*Smokability:* 7/10. Most NEs will give a vague description of an event or person and let you fill in the rest. I find it helpful to envision the skeleton of the event/person in my mind, then build on to that, starting with the question\'s requirements.\n\nExample: A person I admire.\n\nHere the question asks for a person (i.e. cannot be an object or group of people) that I admire (i.e. look up to, respect, aim to be like etc.). I would first think of people I admire, and see if there are any that I can just write about. If not, I would then think about good traits and smush them into one fake person. I would start with ""core"" traits -- characteristics I find essential to being ""admirable"". These core traits could then develop into further characteristics of an admirable character.\n\nDo be aware that ""admirable"" does not simply equate to ""good"", and over the course of the NE, you will have to show that these traits, in certain situations, made the person admirable.\n\n*Something to note: As people are invariably flawed, make sure that your smoked character (if you smoked it) has their own set of flaws, although you do not need to expressly state them. However, a character overcoming their flaws or outgrowing them (character growth!) could also be seen as admirable, so make of that what you will.*\n\nInevitably, you will be describing the person\'s appearance, and so it would be beneficial to have some vocabulary to describe them. You do not, however, need a laundry list of words to do so.\n\nSome areas to describe: The hair and state of it (insight into the way the person grooms him/herself), the way the person carries him/herself, the clothes he/she dresses in, and interesting things about them that might stand out.\n\nExample: *She was a willowy figure, slight of frame, though long in limb. Her eyes were the same muddy brown as her hair, which fell in smooth curtains down her head and flowed around her shoulders. She was not much to look at -- her face was plain; her clothes were simple and drab, and she seemed to curl into herself when she stood, shoulders bent inwards under the weight of the world. And yet, the ferocity of her gaze! What a marvel to behold; all at once, the waif of a girl was transfigured into a queen, all by the intensity of her stare. It was at odds with the smallness; the slightness of her demeanour and body, but it was all part of what made her,* her\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vocabulary/Description-wise:**\n\nI suppose the advice would be to ""show"" and not ""tell"", but I\'m not too fond of that myself. I believe that sometimes brevity is of the essence, and a ""tell"" can have more impact than a ""show"" in some cases. Short, snappy, and succinct, it will draw the reader\'s attention quickly, instead of drawing it *out*. Many scenes can benefit from a good ""tell"", and if you are running low on word count, find a way to make some descriptions less ""showy"".\n\nMany students mistakenly believe that long, extensive descriptions will net them marks in the NE. This is true to an extent, but without good content, and appropriate use of the big vocabulary, there is no benefit to be had. For example, throwing in 10 big words in a single paragraph has no gain if they are not used properly.\n\nFor the sake of being pedantic: Do not ""photosynthesise"" big words incorrectly.\n\ntl;dr: you do NOT need to over-describe. It is a *narrative* essay, not a *descriptive* one. The primary purpose is to *narrate*, i.e. ***tell a story***.\n\nI suppose 5W1H would help you, the student, to develop your writing to some degree, but this is more for planning than actually writing. You do not need to actively 5W1H your plan either -- as you think and plan, you will invariably end up doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Structure-wise:**\n\nA NE has a beginning, and end, and a body. There is no real ""structure"" in a NE, though many write it as though there is one.\n\nMy advice is to begin not by directly quoting the question ""...Here is a person I really admire..."" but to answer it *through* the essay. Easier said than done, I know. Here\'s an example I might do.\n\n1. Describe the person\n2. Something he/she did that I found admirable\n3. How my impression of them was affected/changed and I began to find them admirable (or any other variant)\n\nThere is no real limit or minimum number of paragraphs a student should have. As long as the story is told, and the examiner is not reading a wall of text, then you are generally good to go.\n\nParagraphing is IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Break up your writing!! You don\'t need to fit an entire event into one paragraph. It\'s ok to break them up. Save them eyes pls.', '>Let\'s be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don\'t think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question.\n\nIf I may contend with this:\n\nWhile ""storybooks"" and works of fiction may not necessarily present one with ""real-life"" current affairs content (in the context of an expository essay), I don\'t believe that one should dismiss them so easily. \n\nMany (older) works of fiction have writing styles and a certain use of the English language that may read ""smoother"" or be more ""pleasant"". They also utilise vocabulary rather naturally -- it does not feel forced, and the ability to do so can be learnt. It is by reading widely that we accumulate various writing styles and methods, so while fiction may not have immediate benefits in the realms of general knowledge, picking up on the style/language used would invariably contribute to a better language mark.\n\nThe paper is, after all, 50% language and 50% content. \n\nAs another note, reading widely (and hence including fiction) would provide content for questions about reading, books, philosophy... etc. They may not be ""current affairs"" material, but consider a question that involves discussing culture, traditions, and history. An older piece of fiction could be used as evidence to detail historical practises (with the explanation that works of fiction are often representative of the society at that time). Books on war, like Morpurgo\'s *Warhorse, Friend or Foe, Shadow,* and *The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips* may offer insight into the consequences of war -- on soldiers, on civilians, on society as a whole. And et cetera. You know how the argument goes.\n\nGranted, not everybody has the time to invest into fiction, so I understand when you say you did not read fiction in upper sec. I recall reading books I\'d already read before instead of branching out into new ones. Perhaps they are not the same situation, but I do see where you\'re coming from.\n\nStill, though, I think it\'s kinda unfair to say that they are ""out of the question"". I think there are benefits to be had, either directly or indirectly. \n\nBut again, I see your point. Just my two cents.', 'what assessments should i do?', 'Wished someone had told me this few years ago..\nThanks for the tips, some of them are applicable to General Paper too!', 'oral one coming soon! its always essential to be able to write essays in all styles because you can never predict what is coming out. sticking to one is risky. narrative essays are all about being aware of what the character sees, feels and hears (recall 5W1H).

[Uni][Poly]Messed up my life...need some advice,University :snoo_smile:,1585834740.0,"Sorry for the long text below.

Hi everyone, need some advice on how I should proceed with my current stage in life. 

I graduated poly in 2017 with a poly diploma with a cGPA of 3. Went on to serve NS (medical unit) for 2 years and ORD'd last year. 

I didn't really use my time in NS well to think about what I should do after I ORD and just wasted those 2 years away. Tried applying for SIT Comp Sci near my ORD date because of the demand for IT jobs and I thought that I would be interested in IT. But of course, with no prior educational or work experience in IT, I was rejected. Told myself that I would wait for the next SIT intake next year to try again and took up some part-time jobs in between.

Tried for this year's SIT Comp Sci and also applied for SIM Comp Sci. SIT didn't get back to me so I enrolled into SIM. After starting at SIM, I realise that I might not really be interested in IT and just sort of convinced myself because of the demand...right now I just feel like dropping out.

Currently, I'm thinking of doing something in healthcare or allied health (due to what I went through in NS) such as nursing but that would mean going back to poly for a diploma for another 3 years and I'm not sure if it's the right decision. Another option would be to find a full time job but I feel like no one will hire me because I don't have a lot of relevant work experience for the diploma. Really need some advice on what I should do.

I can't really eat and sleep properly nowadays because of this issue...I just wished I had not made so many poor decisions in life and messed it all up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftmhiv/unipolymessed_up_my_lifeneed_some_advice/,8.0,"['Looks like you really haven‚Äôt found your interest.

Those are not recognized.', 'have you looked into earn&learn programme or specialist diplomas at the five polys? not sure if they have nursing though', 'If you choose to go back to poly, do note that tuition grant will not be available as you completed a diploma course previously.', ""Since you already graduated from Poly with a diploma, going back to Poly to get another diploma is going to be really expensive because you won't qualify for tuition grant. Tuition fees without tuition grant per semester is going to be around $10k if I remember correctly. Also, without tuition grant, you won't be able to apply for financial assistance such as tuition fee loan. So unless you're loaded, going back to poly is probably not a good option.\n\nAn option you can consider is Parkway Health nursing! It's a private diploma and all their student nurses are sponsored by hospitals meaning you get an allowance every month with tuition fees paid and you'll be bonded to a hospital. Maybe the downside is that you won't be able to get into a local university."", ""You're still young and still have a whole life ahead of you. The decisions you made before has already happened, but it is what you do now that will define who you are. \n\nI think that it is important to first find out what you like and what you want to do first before you apply for any course. Take time to think through the reasons why you want to become an allied health professional and then take action. Volunteer at a hospice or seek a shadowing opportunity to find out if you truly want it. \n\nHowever, with the COVID-19 situation, it will be difficult to volunteer and interact with people so what I suggest is that you try to explore the courses available in different universities and list down a few you are interested in. Then, read the course module and take crash course on youtube to see if you like what you are studying. If you don't like what you are studying, it's better not to take that course or consider that path. However, if you are willing to put in the effort despite not liking what you study, then maybe it could still be suitable for you. Also, listen to talks by professionals on youtube to see what the job is like and what are the challenges in the job as well."", ""If you're thinking of health care you could try signing on in scdf as a paramedic. I think it's pretty meaningful work. The training is less than 2 years and after that you're bonded for another 2 years I think.

   1. with rising AI, what effects will Singapore face in the next 10 years?
   2. With reference to Politics and Economics, how should countries reduce the impacts of COVID-19?

Another said I should wait because what if a new better model comes out later in the year.

If I buy it now ...

Pros:
- Working at home sometimes and can use the laptop for meetings (current desktop don't have mic and webcam, encountering some difficulties) 
This COVID-19 may lead me into working more and more from home, provided I'm not fired ü•µ
- can use the laptop before school starts to install stuff and have fun customising it
- don't have the worry about no stock if that actually happens

Cons:
- shorter time of warranty because it doesn't start in August(I'd imagine using it more heavily in Aug) so maybe when it spoils (OH GOD PLEASE NO) I cry
- maybe get salty & jealous when new model comes out 
- won't really use it since I have a phone and a TV to project my phone onto, damn big screen why need laptop lol

[Poly] cgpa 3.1 what to do after getting rejected by unis?,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585813310.0,"Hey there! Hope you are all doing well in this whole ongoing situation but am here to seek advice as to what I should be doing after my diploma. I‚Äôve applied for local unis however my gpa is only 3.1. portfolio is really outstanding. No regrets on my poly education cause I‚Äôve done my best despite my own circumstances. 

Recently friends around me have been getting interview invites and seeing that happening to them is hard-warming, but I actually broke down right after cause it hit me that I highly likely won‚Äôt be getting a spot in Uni. 

I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs has things planned out early and this time round it seems like for once I don‚Äôt? Wanted to apply for overseas Uni to do speech and language therapy/ occupational therapy but after going through an overseas internship stint I realised that I get homesick way too easily & wasn‚Äôt a feasible option. 

Current plan is to wait for rejection letters from unis to come in and then I‚Äôll start applying for jobs in the healthcare ( Community care ) or ncss sector and after that I‚Äôll have 2 options of undergrad studies 

1. Nus adult learner programme to do their FASS degree and major in social work 

Pros: 

nus cert would be more reputable as I may want to pursue masters in ntu‚Äôs gerontology 

Cons: 
only accept applicants with 4 years of working experience pertaining to say that I‚Äôll be 25 when I‚Äôm studying then & only getting a degree when I‚Äôm 28/29.

Have to drop work when I‚Äôm studying this cause it‚Äôs a full time programme 

2. Suss part time social work programme 

Pros: 
Part time programme hence I‚Äôll be able to juggle both work and studies 

Cons:
Degree Might not be recognised by ntu for my masters. 

have sources claiming that suss social work grads don‚Äôt get jobs easily 

I‚Äôm particularly interested in the healthcare sector ( nursing ) but there‚Äôs no private degree for me to do cause it‚Äôs all TOP-ups so I‚Äôll have to start from diploma if I want to pursue nursing but I‚Äôm not keen on doing that hence the shift towards social work. 

To seniors who completed poly and went on to work.. was it tough? And did you guys further studies in the end ?

[A Levels] Some common mistakes students make in General Paper Essays (Abridged),Junior Colleges :karma:,1585803099.0,"Hello! 

So, I'm attempting to pay it forward again for JC students. But before we begin, I'd like to emphasise - please, please, please stay safe. Stay at home as much as possible on your e-learning day. Sanitise your hands regularly!

Anyway, this is an abridged version of my blog post on GP essays . These are some of the common mistakes that should be mitigated as much as possible. The thing about GP - as someone who went through this gauntlet - is that these mistakes, no matter how small they may be, can easily add up. Without further ado, let's get into it!

**#1 - Not defining the key terms and setting parameters in a question** 

This is important as doing so will give you a roadmap for your essay, and potentially open up different interpretations. It may also cause you to think in binary terms. (See below)

**#2 - Vague arguments that do not answer the question**

This means writing stuff like ""Yes, indeed, the government is responsible,"" in response to a question like, ""To what extent is the government responsible for individual welfare""? It's not enough to simply give a stand, you need to be more specific w.r.t. *why the government is responsible*.

**#3 - Balance = Thinking in binary terms**

To many students, balance means an argument and a *direct* counter-argument. This isn't balance - *it's contradiction*. To me, balance means being accurate. In short, we can argue for something, say... ""practice is a very effective way to study"" *while pointing out its limitations*. This is still balance.

**#4 - Narrating examples instead of establishing the link** 

This means giving too much detail on the example, instead of explaining how it proves your point. It prevents you from being concise and staying laser-focused. 

**#5 - Disregarding grammar**

This mistake is something that undermines your language score, sure. But the bigger problem is that it prevents a clear expression of your arguments. It's really simple - if the examiners don't understand what you're saying, they can't give credit where it's due. 

So, yeah. These are, to be honest, elementary mistakes - i.e., you shouldn't be making them. But I'm pretty sure we all space out sometimes and lose our awareness of these things. (Trust me... It happens so many times. Even for me, as an adult.) This post is meant to help you stay aware of these mistakes!

Hopefully this helps. If you have any other questions, do PM me, or you can simply head on over to my blog for the 5 common mistakes on GP [essays](https://www.gpspectrum.com/post/5-common-mistakes-in-general-paper-essays)! (Much more details there, including quick solutions to these mistakes.)

Currently working in quite a good electronics company as a Senior Technician for almost 1.5 years now. Honestly, I don't really like my job but I don't really have a choice.

I have been thinking of furthering my studies but I am not sure what options I have with my pathetic cGPA. I have been trying to apply all the local Uni (NTU, NUS, SUTD and SIT) since 2018 after I graduated but as you can see, I didn't get in.

Maybe some background:

* What do my parents think?

Luckily, I have a very supportive family and they are fine with all my choices as long as I'm happy. Even so, I still hope I can further my studies with minimal cost so that I will not burden my family too much.

* Do you have a good portfolio?

I have a relatively good portfolio in Poly? I was the Vice-President of my school club which is event-based. I also volunteer in my temple almost every week. And maybe that's it. I think these won't be enough to get into any local uni here.

Are there other options for me regarding further studies, should I change my path? If no options at all, should I consider overseas studies or should I continue working for a few more years? Feel free to be savage (maybe not too much), I really need some advise and directions.

[O Levels] Please don't undermine private tutors in this time of need,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585795098.0,"I'm a private tutor. I run a small tuition centre. After deducting rent, marketing & administrative costs - I take home around $2500 a month. I teach more than 10 classes weekly.

It has been a very demoralising few weeks.

1. Amidst the suspension of centre-based tuition classes - parents have asked for discount on fees. I tried to help whenever I can by waiving off fees or giving discounts, knowing fully that it will be at my own expense.

Yet, I've received a lot of comments from parents who do not have financial difficulties, going ""e-learning should be cheaper"".

e-Learning IS not cheaper than classroom based learning. It has been 2 sleepless weeks with this mad scramble to move classes online. We've had to to spend sessions doing orientation for you and your children to help explain how to do classes online. We had to buy IT equipment, video recording equipment - all of it not cheap with my measly $2500 monthly salary.

You think it's less effort - it's not. It's more effort and more work. And you want to pay us less.

Please don't undermine our efforts by requesting to pay us less. If you have financial difficulties, we will discount for you. But don't say ""e-Learning should be paid less"". Thanks.

Rental still goes on - landlords who don't take the initiative to help and pass on rental rebates, I'm looking at YOU!

2. We totally understand that why we have been closed down. Health comes first - sure.

However, can don't call us non-essential?

School is essential, tuition is non-essential. Minister said that. True facts of life.

But, but. Can you also see this.

In every sector, there are good people and there are bad people.

In the tuition sector, there are some of us good ones and some of us bad ones.

I dare say, I care about each and every-one of my students. I do my best to motivate. I do my best to talk to them when they have family troubles. I come up with extra worksheets when I know they are lagging behind.

In schools, you also have teachers who are not motivated, who only come to school for the paycheck and do the minimum.

If all school teachers are good - need tuition teachers for what?

If everybody scoring A1, A2 and A\* - then no need for tuition. Some parents find tuition because their kids have been failing.

We don't need you to recognise us. But don't call us non-essential can?

3. Common comment from school teachers and from the public - ""They should pay school teachers more"" or ""Tuition teachers make so much money"".

You know how many times I roll my eyes at this?

Straits Times - I'm looking at you. Thanks for always reporting on ""million dollar"" tutors. Now everybody thinks that all tutors make millions.

Reality check - If you are a school teacher and you think you will make a lot of money leaving the public sector, feel free to go try your luck.

Is every school teacher a Principal? or a Cluster Superintendent? or a Director? No right?

Same thing with the private sector ok? The top tutors make a lot of money. The normal tutors like us make close to the 'median' $4600 of the typical Singaporean.

We don't have CPF.

We don't have AWS.

We don't have performance bonus.

In November & December, we eat bread but still pay rent.

Whatever we earn in 10 months, must ration across 12 months, because November & December parents go holiday and don't want tuition.

No - regular tutors don't make millions.

Stop dreaming. Most school teachers are not zai. If they leave the public sector, they will eat grass.

I make $2500 a month - if you feel that is fantastic, you can be my guest. You have a choice. If you think you can make more as a private tutor, take the plunge into the world of the unknown.

4. Teachers got a lot of admin work, not like private tutor only need to teach

We don't have admin work. We have ""admin work"" - marketing, accounting & trying to keep the business alive. We don't only teach.

You have a 'clear thick' line between yourself and parents. We don't. We are obligated to answer, and talk to parents everyday. Do you know there are parents who call us and talk to us everyday about their kids and their anxieties? (a lot of parents from top schools are actually very anxious about their kids) I spend 1 to 2 hours daily talking to 2 to 3 parents everyday.

5. Thank you for classifying us together with KTVs, Bars & Entertainment

I called the bank to lower my credit card interest because in anticipation of school closures, I invested heavily in video recording equipment and IT equipment that I actually cannot pay for with my measly salary.

Guess what the bank said? You are not from an eligible 'adversely affected' sector.

Adversely affected = tourism, aviation, F&B and entertainment.

Entertainment qualifies but private education doesn't qualify.

Again, i understand why we have been shut down. But can everyone remember us private tutors have families to feed too? Mortgages or rent to pay? Bills to pay?

6. We are human beings too

We have feelings. We have empathy. We have tried to help whenever we can. My tuition centre offers free tuition all these years to whomever are on MOE Financial Assistance scheme. When parents face difficulties (retrenched, fell sick), we always cut our fees or give free. When students ask for extra help, we coach and we don't charge extra.

We are trying our best too. Really. We are all in this together.

I don't know since when being a 'private tutor' is a nasty thing.

Maybe tuition centres like Learning Lab, Mavis Tutorial or any of those big tuition centres with big MRT and bus adverts and sprawling land space of more than 10000 square feet might make millions of dollars a year. Maybe they have strong investors with hundreds of millions. But hey that's not us. Don't assume that we have a mountain of profits to stomach this because we don't.

Also, a lot of our kids and a lot of our parents always tell us that school teachers always say bad things about private tutors. ""Tuition is a waste of money"", ""don't need go for tuition"", ""private tutors are not qualified and don't know what they are teaching"".

Some teachers seem to spend a lot of time bad-mouthing private tutors.

Grass always seem to be greener on the other side.

You get your bonuses, your CONNECT plan, your PB and your 13th month. When the economy does well - you get extra money for doing absolutely nothing extra.

2 to 3 year 'old' Teachers pay around $5k to $6k. HOD teachers pay is ""7k to 10k"". VPs more. Ps on Superscale can make $200+ k per year. Stop making comparisons and keep saying private tutors make more.

Just focus on teaching your kids please. You still have a job.

I may not have one when the dust settles.

Also, remember that a lot of us private tutors were once school teachers.

Some of us left because of school mergers.

Some of us left because we were pregnant, had kids and could no longer cope.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with this thing called EPMS.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with all the politics, committees, organising overseas trips and want to just focus on the kids.

(I mean... come on, really?!)\n\nNevertheless, this is something EVERYONE is going through together, regardless of who they are. I have friends in the gig economy or in the private sector (regularly paid jobs) who have been temporarily laid off. So, we should really engage in constructive dialogue rather than ranting. We can also find ways to adapt, like tightening our belts, or even finding a 2nd job. We work hard to add value to the education landscape - and I firmly believe this pays off in the end, not just for ourselves, but for the younger generation.\n\nStay strong, man. Happy to talk more about this with fellow tutors in these hard times."", 'True. Am a student myself and my Econs tutor was complaining about how they only had 1 day to react to the shutting down of centres. Everything was rushed and am suprised the lesson turned out smoothly. Really appreciated it. \n\nParents should understand the needs of private tutors at this point of time, and not just exploit the situation in their favour.  But this is easier said than done since most of them do really have a choice to switch tutors/stop tuition eg. and this would put the private tutors at a disadvantage (because of the competitiveness of tuition services in Singapore) to explain to them. \n\nSome school teachers don‚Äôt really bother about students having tuition teachers as to them, its the results that matters in the end. Though this is true, I have had several encounters of secondary sch teachers and jc teachers who speak badly of tuition teachers, saying that they are ‚Äúnot updated with the syllabus‚Äù, does not know the ‚Äúformat that Cambridge expects‚Äù eg. I mean, its the student‚Äôs choice whether to have tuition or not since we are the ones in charge of our own education. It‚Äôs also wrong to critic the tuition industry since they are also trying to make a living.', ""As a private student tutor myself, I empathise with the additional hours of work and effort you have to put in to gather all these resources to move tuition online. But at the end of the day, no job/business is safe and secure due to the unpredictabilities one may face in future, just like the current COVID19 crisis. When business earn a lot of money, they also don't give back these extra profits to their consumers who contributed to their profits right? There are risks undertaken into running a business, and we cannot always assume it to be a 100% success. \n\nNo doubt it is true that additional expenditure and time is spent on IT/Tech appliances and resources to ensure Elearning goes as smoothly as possible for every student you have, as a tutor myself, I highly doubt that online tuition as opposed to face-to-face tuition is more effective, and thus you see some parents scrambling here and there demanding cheaper tuition fees etc etc. For instance, online tuition doesnt allow for the catering of students with different learning speeds( not impossible but a rather tedious, arduous process), but tuition face to face works. I believe as a full time tutor youself, you know that for sure too. Justifying the additional costs spent on IT stuff is merely a reason to account for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced, but should not be exacerbated as a veto factor for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced. If online tuition could replace physical tuition/teaching, there wouldn't be a point in having schools right? Moreover with the roll out of HBL/SLS assignments in schools, there is less of an incentive for parents to have their child go for online tuition if teachers in schools right now are doing it also (also helped out in a sch to set up resources for a certain subject too last week, and probably over the course of next few weeks).\n\nJust my two cents worth. No doubt your current circumstance may be an agonising one, but the difference in quality/delivery of a tuition lesson one may receive online as opposed to one whereby the teacher is physically present to me has significant nuances."", 'This should go onto mothership...', 'Can summarize?', 'There‚Äôs no one size fits all solution unfortunately....\n\nThank you for your sacrifices and genuinely not being condescending, I think you can look for financial assistance. \n\nhttps://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/covid-19-financial-assistance-retrenchment/', 'Ok non essential worker', 'As a private tutor, I agree with you fully!

[Rant] Close offices and schools,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585752908.0,"1000 cases. 54 local, 25 unlinked. Yes its incomparable to other countries, but Singapore is small, and very densely populated. With an increase in cases, the hospitals would be unable to take care of these patients as well as before. More people are going to die.

&#x200B;

To restrict all gatherings to less than 10 people and yet still have people go to work/ school is the most hypocritical thing I have heard. We have to be ahead of the virus, not behind it. Keeping offices and schools open when there are other options such as home-based learning is wrong.

&#x200B;

Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease. Children can spread the disease, and also DIE from it. I am sure no parent wants their child to be the first child to die. If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we? They have schools open for only children whom cannot stay at home.

&#x200B;

The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. You wont ever be able to fix your economy if your citizens have died.

Anything? What about the single mother with two children working multiple part time jobs? How is she to help her children have any sense of normalcy if a sudden shutdown were to be imposed? What about the family in a single room HDB that can‚Äôt afford a computer? If everything shuts down how are they to continue studies and keep pace with everyone else? I think many are speaking from a position of privilege and fail to see that this is a very real existential issue for thousands of singaporean households. What about parents who are at the front line of health care? Do they go back to take care of their children and compromise our primary defence against the virus?\n\n>If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nThe UK, as did most of the West, has completely bungled its response to the coronavirus, and was forced to take draconian measures to stop the tidal wave they introduced. Both the US and UK have also had to cancel national exams, throwing millions of students into a state of uncertainty for their future and ambitions. I think it‚Äôd be fairer to compare public health measures with Taiwan and Japan, for instance. \n\n> The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. \n\nI agree that in the long term, public health and the state of the economy aren‚Äôt diametrically opposed. However, it is unfair to compare this to SARS. Look at the US. Relatively unscathed by SARS. For the coronavirus, unemployment claims now stand at more than 3 million, the highest it has been in American history (here‚Äôs a graph as reference: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-3-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week-almost-5-times-the-record-high/) Think about trade-dependent Singapore in that context. Have you gone to the airport recently? Tourism in Singapore is essentially dead. Retail is dead. Disproportionate consequences for the poorest in our society. No rational company will be seeking to employ with these economic conditions. This is projected to be the worst recession in Singapore‚Äôs history. The government has offered unemployment benefits, which it has almost never substantially done in its decades of rule. As the US, Malaysia, China falter, a second wave of economic crisis for us. This is a far more severe economic problem. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs a game of costs and benefits, and the fact of the matter is that the situation is more nuanced than most would likely hope it to be. No perfection to be found on earth. I took a look at your post history and you‚Äôve asked a similar question 2 weeks ago, and commenters there have given very valid points you should have considered"", 'I will just explain why the economy being bad is DIRE. \n\nassuming schools are close, our economy worsens.  this will result in retrenchment. \nand hence, those working in retail,  your taxi uncle or even your waiter will have no job. \n\nwhat will happen to their family? \nthey will have limited savings,  and they have to compete with others to buy for necessities to cope with covid. prices of stuff like toilet paper and staple food HAS risen. and it will continue to rise if economy worsens.  and Singaporeans will panic buy and with their limited savings, they can only buy a few. and i think they will die faster before covid hits them. #hardtruths\n\nwhat will happen to all of us? some of us may not even be retrenched.\n\nbecause we have an increased in the number of needies (you mention theres other way to help them without schools right),govt has to pull more money to help them. they have to spend on 1) delivering the items to them 2)finding out who they are (who got retrenched recently, who is below the poverty line...) 3) spending money to help them get over this tough time\n\nand since money doesnt fall from the sky, this means LESSER funds to go into healthcare. Lesser masks, lesser funds to buy more covid-19 swab, lesser funds to operate the hospital and many more.. \nwhat will that mean?  MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.  MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE CURED.  THIS WILL GET OUR OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE LOGISTICS.  OH NO', 'Many ministers and country leaders have said that Covid-19 may drag on longer than expected, even until next year, so do you suggest that we close schools and offices till next year as well? Many schools taking IB are already affected with the cancellation(?) of their exams which could affect their university applications. Are we just going to pause everything we‚Äôre doing till 2020 is over and pretend that nothing has happened?\n\nIMO, with how open Singapore is, there‚Äôs always going to be new cases like how we‚Äôll have to face many waves of cases (eg. China, UK/US), so there‚Äôs not really a way to stop the number to 0 unless you want to stop visitors from coming in and cause our already-slowing tourism industry will continue to dry out.\n\n‚ÄúThe economy will not collapse‚Äù How are you so sure? I actually believe that this is only the start (of Covid-19 and also of the effects on our economy) and many times, the effects will actually continue to spill over even when the outbreak is controlled. If you didn‚Äôt know, Singapore‚Äôs economy already started slowing down in 2019 and there were hints of a possible recession in end-2019 even without Covid-19. Latest release by MAS showed current projection is about -1 to -4% in GDP, drop from the initial projection of -0.5 to -1%, that‚Äôs about 4x. If the schools and offices were to close, the contraction will be even larger and companies may end up forcing their employees to take unpaid leaves if Covid-19 continues.\n\nWhile there may be all the different packages pushed out by the Govt to support all the employers and employees, money doesn‚Äôt drop from the sky. You can‚Äôt expect to keep pulling out money without putting money in, can you? There is a limit to the amount we have in our reserves and we shouldn‚Äôt take them for granted.\n\nMaybe what you can do now is to practice good hygiene and good money habits.', "">If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nplease look at the UK.  is the UK doing anything better than us? \n\n>The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine.\n\nhow naive of you to think that the SARS is comparable to COVID? the SARS is afraid of the heat,  COVID is not.  COVID would not.  SARS lasted for five months and this is already the fifth month of COVID and it isnt getting any better\n\nThe ECONOMY will collapse. Yes we are fine now from the consequences of SARS,  but repercussions are terrible if we completely ignore them after it.  If we have not reach that stage yet,  let's not close them down.

As baseline reference, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, UChicago have around a 5% acceptance rate. Duke, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins around 8%. NYU, Cornell, Tufts around 10-15%. Consider that applicants to these schools are self-selecting, i.e that the acceptance rate is in the context of a immensely talented application pool. Recommend you check which individual schools you want to apply, they release admission rate statistics every year. If you apply for financial aid to need-aware schools, it becomes very, very hard to get in. As an Asian international from an overrepresented country (I assume SG), your application also becomes less competitive. International students make up a relatively small percentage of most US undergraduate college populations as a result.

Firstly, kudos for surviving JC till now! It\'s not an easy fight, but will be fulfilling in the end.\n\nI was in JC in 2013 and 2014 (and got into NUS FASS in 2015). My first year was fine, but second year was HORRENDOUS. In the beginning of the year, I topped the cohort in my Geog test, but my Physical Geog teacher (who was also my Form Teacher) mocked me in front of my class saying ""You spot topic one right? Thats why you scored so well"". That de-motivated me A LOT and I started scoring badly for Geog. (Like shouldn\'t a teacher be encouraging instead of mocking their students like that?) I also started feeling really de-motivated about studying other subjects in general (I am a person who gets affected easily by what other people say of me). Though I did not score Us, but it was still a failing grade. I scored pretty badly for my tests and prelim, IIRC I scored 40+ or 50+ RP...\n\nHowever, knowing that I have a goal in mind (which is, to enter a Local Uni), I knew that I can\'t continue to fail and waste 2 years of my education. So, I started to look for my teachers (for Math and Econs), and started reading more notes and doing more TYS, When I say look for my teachers, I literally signed myself up for every single ""remedial"" ""tutorial"" classes possible so that I can do more practices and be able to clear my doubts almost immediately if any. Night study was useful too because there would be many students studying together and the atmosphere would be good for studying.\n\nIn the end,  I miraculously scored 75 for A-Levels. Not as excellent, but I\'m satisfied.

I think it is very important to customize your own notes in such a way that you feel comfortable. This applies even in the University journey.\n\nI think one can score well if he or she gets the bigger picture of the whole subject and link between each topics.

[Scholarships] General Scholarship Interview Board Advice,Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585727685.0,"As the title says. I don't cover the other aspects of scholarship selection process (too many). I assume it is an individual interview board (1 interviewee to many interviewers). My examples are heavily skewed towards scholarships offered by the civil service, but the general principles still apply to private organisations. Can also be useful for general university admission interviews too. Here goes:

&#x200B;

1. Know the scholarship organisation.

Don't go for the interview thinking that CAAS manages healthcare, or that LTA is under MSF. Go to the organisation's website and scrutinise the ""about us"" section, as well as resources on their policies. Summarise it into an easy-to-remember 5W1H about the organisation. Know what the organisation's mission and aims are, as they can be the core to your responses for difficult questions. For example, MINDEF's mission is to ""enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy"". So, if they ask you questions regarding (for example) countries who may be aggressive to us and how we may defend ourselves against them, your answer is literally there. The baseline is deterrence and diplomacy - how do you go about doing that? You just need to build on that foundation and flesh out your thoughts. Know what your organisation stands for, and be creative and flexible within that framework. Of course, this is not saying that you cannot give answers based on alternative foundations. Continuing from the above example, I may think that instead of deterrence and diplomacy, throwing money at the problem works too. However, you will need to have a damned good reason for holding that belief, and you will have to justify it on very solid grounds if you want to go that way. The most extraordinary individuals will have opinions like these.

&#x200B;

2. Be *very* familiar with the issues facing your organisation now, and in the future.

Your scholarship organisation is not looking to give you money for free. You are an investment to them, and you need to show that their investment in you will not be wasted. This means that you need to demonstrate an awareness of problems and policies, so that you can be a future leader in the organisation. I cannot stress this enough. This means you must know the following:

a. What are the problems facing this organisation now, or the problems that this organisation is looking to address?

b. What are the current solutions/policies that are in place, and their limitations?

c. What are the future/foreseeable/potential problems that this organisation will face in the future?

Parts A and B are easy. Just read the organisation's webpage, newspaper articles and other reference materials. You might need to reverse engineer policies to figure out what problem they are addressing, but those are relatively straightforward.

Part C is the most difficult. You need to read up extensively for this. Usually, policymakers will allude to problems that we will face down the road in newspaper articles or parliamentary debates. You can also have your own ideas on the potential problems that may be faced, but make sure its logical. For example, if you're going to be interviewed at MND, land use and availability is going to be a huge concern down the road (it already is now, but it'll only get worse). So, if we need more space to build, what could we do about it? We can either build further upward, or we can go underground. Or we can get more land. Dump more sand into the sea? Create more land between Tekong and the mainland? Turn Singapore's 63 islands into one huge landmass? Annex part of Malaysia? What are the pros and cons of each? Why is one solution perhaps preferred over another, in your opinion? These are the trains of thought that you will need to possess. Again, problem solving and policymaking is a key aspect of your future career, and you can bet that they will test you on this.

&#x200B;

3. Have your own opinion/stance.

What this means is, if the MFA interviewer decides to ask you whether we should support the US or China *in times of conflict*, it is probably not a good idea to say ""I think we should support both/neither"". Even though in practice, yes, we do exactly that during peacetime, the context of the question is forcing you to choose a stance. I am doubtful that they would ask the question minus ""in times of conflict"", because the standard answer during peacetime is very clear, and there's really no need to ask giveaway questions. They want to test your analytical skills, awareness of Singapore's interests, and ability to make a judgement call. You do not want to come across as someone who cannot decide, or makes bad (read: unjustifiable) decisions. Remember, you are being assessed at being a policymaker. You cannot make policy if you can't decide. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions based on your answers too. In addition, after you've committed yourself to a stance, stick to it unless you realise you've made a huge mistake. For example, if you say we should support the US because it's rules based yada yada, then don't give an answer later on that seems to suggest the opposite (eg we should support Russia because Putin is a great guy). However, if you realise you've truly f\*cked up based on the line of questioning you're getting (""why do you say Venezuela is similar to Singapore in terms of corruption?""), then you should withdraw what you've said and accept the new information given to you. It can either come across as you being open minded, or you having said something badly mistaken, depending on what you just said. Which brings me to...

&#x200B;

4. Don't smoke your way in interviews.

The panel of interviewers are career professionals. They know exactly what they are talking about. They likely know that you're trying to bluff them, and depending on how serious they are, they can question you repeatedly until it becomes clear to everyone involved that you're smoking, in which case you're done for. Don't let yourself get into this position - point 2 is key. If they ask you something that you really cannot answer, be upfront about it - I'm sorry but I am not familiar with this topic. Could you give me a background or could we discuss a different topic? If you do this once, it's probably acceptable. If you do this too many times, it means you don't know much about the organisation. Give reasonable and logical answers.

&#x200B;

5. Miscellaneous interview things

First impressions count. Even though interviews are likely to be virtual now, it's not excuse for skimping on the basics. Which means, be early. Not on time. *Early*. Dress appropriately and well. Confidence (but not braggadocio) when the interview starts. Sit up straight. Smile. Hands either clasped on the table or on your lap. No fidgeting. Minimise ums and ahs. You can see yourself on the computer screen now, use it to your advantage in addressing the above. Thank the interviewers for their time at the end. Convey a sense of gratitude that you are called for the interview. Don't be that d\*bag that treats scholarships as a god-given right to you.

When the interviewers ask you to describe yourself, give an elevator pitch (meaning 30 seconds to 1 minute, tops). Who are you, why do you want the scholarship and why you are a good fit for the organisation and vice versa. No one on the board is interested in listening to how you love trains for 5 minutes if you are interviewing at MOH. I wouldn't go so far as to say avoid saying irrelevant things about yourself, but everything you say in this pitch should have a purpose. If you really want to talk about how you have a piano diploma, it should have some link or relevance to the scholarship, else you might as well not mention it.

For personality/character questions, you should prepare for them beforehand. What are your strengths and weaknesses, most inspiring person in your life, a time when you failed and how you recovered, that kinda thing. These are easy to think about, reflect who you are as a person and you should have some idea of how you might answer these questions before the interview.

There are also some interview questions that are... interesting. I've heard of interview questions like ""if you were a tree, what would you feel?"". I have no good answer for how to answer these questions. I get the feeling that these questions are a conduit for you to express your personality/thoughts in a de-personalised way, but imo there are much better ways to ask these questions. If you get them, don't panic and don't make a fool of yourself.

You should also come across as being enthusiastic about the organisation, or at least genuinely interested in it. That can mean having a passion for the job. For example, if you're going for a teaching scholarship, how do you know that it is for you? Maybe you've taught tuition before and really enjoyed the process of giving knowledge to others. That kinda thing. But don't overdo or fake it. It's really obvious when people are doing that.

Usually, the interviewers will ask you if you have questions. It would be good to have one or two. They must not be dumb questions (""where is the headquarters of this organisation? Who's the boss? Do I get lunch breaks?""). They can be questions like, ""what is the best thing about working here? what can I look forward to as a scholar here?"" Convey a sense of curiosity and anticipation (and maybe commitment) to the organisation. It's your last chance to make a good impression.

&#x200B;

Lastly, remember that scholarships are not the end of your journey. If you get it, it's just the beginning. Don't take it for granted that you will get it, and if you do get it, treasure it and don't regret it. I'll hang around the thread to answer questions here and there, if there are any. PMs are welcome too. I'm open to opinions for improvement/criticism of this post too.

I have a few choices:

1) Specialist Diploma: downside is that the intake is every year June and July so i can only get in, the following year due to my ORD date. I would have to wait another year for the next intake. However, i emailed them and they say its possible to exempt some modules if i happen to get into a degree, example SUSS's biomedical engineering

2) Specialist Diploma choice 2: October intake, but might not have exemptions as it is not tied to SUSS‚Äôs modules. (NYP‚Äôs biomedical and pharmaceutical specialist diploma). Would it be worth it? 

2) Just apply for SUSS part time biomedical engineering. Although i prefer studying full time, i think since i cant get in to any of the local uni, this is my best bet.

[UNI] AUS/US/UK Medical Schools,University :snoo_smile:,1585703441.0,"Hey! Can anyone who has decided/ got accepted to overseas medical schools please share your experience  (such as tests u took etc.) And most importantly, how are you planning to afford it? (What are good loans to take, or bursaries/scholarships available?)

(Context: overseas unis are soooo expensive, my fanily is not well off so I will have to handle the fees myself. Got rejected to do local med :/ but not ready to give up the dream!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fsplxn/uni_aususuk_medical_schools/,14.0,"[""Not studying overseas but perhaps giving my two cents to help you set some expectation straights. Bursary & Scholarships are almost impossible to get for overseas medical education (less President Scholarship) I helped you look into A\\* Scholarship as well but it's also only for local medical studies. Fundamentally, a scholar would have to return to the sponsoring organisation to serve out his/her bonds, but there's no incentives for organisation to sponsor your medical studies because you would have to serve in the hospitals. Also, local universities are producing sufficient doctor for the near future so even less incentives. Your best bet would be to go overseas and study and pay out of your own pocket and hope to apply for MOHH Pre Employment Grant. Again to set out some expectations here, PEG are increasingly harder and harder to get as well ([http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application](http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application)) It guarantees you a job back in Singapore upon graduation so win-win I would say. \n\nPrepare to set aside about half a million for tuition + living accommodation if you are set on going down this path. Yes, as a doctor you would definitely be able to afford it *EVENTUALLY.* But note that a HO is paid $3650 gross basic, and MO is paid $4500 + $500 basic. If you include calls and stuff maybe add in \\~$400? An associate consultant is paid around $9000-$10000 but that's provided you made it through residency and you would be about early 30s by then. So math it out roughly on your possible loan repayment plans. Again to set expectations, not everyone would gain a residency spot and a lot ended up as chronic MO and leave the service after 5 years to private practice. But on a brighter side, locum pays about $100/hr and a GP working in a chain get paid about $15k. So actually if you would want to skip all the hospital work, you can go overseas study, do part of your training overseas and return to Singapore to work and earn the sweet and comfy $15k, should be able to pay off your debt fairly quickly if you are smart with your money.\n\nAlternatively you can try for Duke NUS through train programmes with some of the universities or look into other healthcare degrees then pursue Duke NUS again if you are sure this is for you."", 'Are you planning to try local med again?', 'How‚Äôs your BMAT?', 'How are your extracurriculars like? Are they excellent? If you do not mind taking a gap year to do volunteer work and work on your ECs I think that you will stand a higher chance next year if you try again! Especially if you go for internships and such, but it‚Äôll be kind of tough to look for one now considering the COVID-19 situation.\n\nUS Medical Schools are out of the question as they are all Postgrad and you would have to do an Undergrad degree in the US/CANADA/UK first. They are also extremely competitive and to get into the top few you have to have an extremely attractive portfolio as an Undergrad. Since you said that you‚Äôd have to handle the fees yourself I won‚Äôt advice this option!\n\nFor UK generally they do accept A-Level students as long as you achieve a good BMAT/UKCAT score. I‚Äôm not that sure about scholarships though. They do offer scholarships to international students for sure, but that may vary from University to University so you‚Äôd have to do in-depth research! Email them and ask about their scholarships.\n\nI think AUS is one of the most suitable options for you. Their currency is similar to that of Singapore‚Äôs and AUS is also closer to Singapore (in fact poorer now if I‚Äôm not wrong). Their cost of living and tuition fees in general are less costly compared to the UK. You can try Monash. Monash‚Äôs extremely popular for Singaporeans, but you‚Äôd have to take the ISAT. Monash‚Äôs medical program is only 5 years long too so tuition would be more affordable. University of Adelaide costs $500,000 for their 6 year Undergrad medicine. Monash would be a better option if you do intend to head to AUS!\n\nI‚Äôm personally a Polytechnic student. Graduated last year from SP with the Diploma in Biomedical Science and am currently serving my NS. My GPA‚Äôs (3.5) definitely not high enough for local Medical Schools (especially NUS). I honestly don‚Äôt believe in the fact that NUS uses entirely holistic admissions. Ultimately GPA/RP plays a huge role in their decisions. I‚Äôm opting for Postgraduate Medicine which is something you can do as well. It‚Äôll definitely take a longer time - 8 years in total instead of 5 to 6 years, but if you really want to do Medicine I think you should just go for it if nothing else works out. \n\nYou could do a BSc in Life Sciences/Biomedical Sciences/Biological Sciences at NTU/NUS then pursue a MD at Duke-NUS. I think that doctors who attain their Medical degrees at the Postgrad level can make extremely good doctors too, especially with the amount of exposure they can get during their Undergrad years that can make them even more mature. \n\nI‚Äôm personally going to do a BSc in Yale-NUS (waitlisted though) or in the UK/AUS before doing Postgrad Med.

NEW Scholarship Interview [SCHOLARSHIP],Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585684227.0,"This is just a record of what I went through during the NEW scholarship interview recently. I have been trying to find information on this particular scholarship on Reddit but have failed to do so. I hope this post would give future scholarship applicants insight into how the interview works and what can you expect in the interview. I applied for this scholarship in hopes of getting the NEA scholarship so that I would at least have a job after studying environmental studies/ earth sciences in uni since the employment rate and job prospects in general for this area of study is relatively poor. Due to the COVID-19 situation, the interview was also held on a zoom call but I would assume that it is similar to the offline experience. The interview started at around 0830 and there was some orientation ( for us it was the features of a zoom call, but it could be familiarisation of the offline place instead) for about 30 mins. We then proceeded onto our first activity which was held at a group level, with a total number of 8 participants for each interview time slot. This was a case study and us having to come up with solutions to the problem in the case study and presenting our points to the assessors and admin staff. I think the key idea here is to lead the discussion and not be led since there are always assessors watching you, even if you are not aware of it. The first activity was rather simple, with many heads contributing ideas, it wasn't hard for us to reach a satisfactory answer at the end of 20 mins. We then had a 5 min break.

The next activity was done at a smaller group level ( the interviewees being split into 2 separate teams ). Here, we were presented with a case study and we had to engage in discussions to support our give topic sentence. We had to debate with the other team and argue for our case ( think of it as an essay where you are discussing the for and they are discussing the against). Once again, it is important to show initiative as the assessors will not know you have good ideas until you voice them out. Do not be shy since everyone is probably as nervous as you are. During this activity, stay on topic and not just ramble on and on about what you have learnt in school, this caused a lot of time to be wasted during my discussion period as 1 of the candidates vomited out what he had learnt in school, without any thought of the question ahead. The debate part was fun, and once again do not be afraid to speak up as you might be seen as lacklustre due to your lack of motivation and participation. There was a 5 min break after this.

The last activity was an individual presentation where we had to come up with a solution to tackle the problem while taking many other factors into consideration. This was quite stressful as you were alone and will only be given 20 min to prepare a word document or PowerPoint slide for the presentation. The presentation includes 3 mins of presentation time and 2 mins of Q&A session. This can be quite fun if you have unique ideas that you think will catch the assessors' eyes. Don't forget to speed through the presentation as you probably will not have enough time to present all that you have prepared. Be ready to think on the spot as the assessors will throw you questions regarding your presentation, and some of the questions can be a curveball that could ruin your otherwise perfect interview.TLDR: the interview was fun and just have fun. I believe that if you have what it takes, you will strive no matter what conditions you are placed under.I hope this post will give you information and further insight into the NEW scholarship interview.

Hello everyone. I‚Äôm not going to reveal my identity here at this platform but I just need some help/suggestions from you guys. I am a 17 year old teen. So what I‚Äôve just found out recently was that my mother had ‚Äústolen‚Äù $550 away from me, without my consent/permission, (she just kept quiet as if nothing has happened) which was my savings and my Ang pow money collected in 2019 and 2020. She had already done this for more than one occasion and she said that she‚Äôll return me back my money but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt happen and she will return the amount lesser than the amount she had taken. Like say when I‚Äôm outside paying for something, she will ask me to pay first and she will return the cash back to me but in the end it doesn‚Äôt happen. This is actually kind of affecting my studies and sometimes I am stressed about this thing that happened and I can‚Äôt concentrate and furthermore my o levels are around the corner.

Say u have C2H6O, u can draw it as ethanol or CH3-O-CH3. Basically means that u shift O in between the carbons. Can‚Äôt really put this one in words soz :‚Äô)\n\nNext, positional isomers! It just means like attach the group that u got like CC double bond or -OH group onto different carbon atoms. Take butene for example, now there are 2 ways to draw it, which is the double bond between carbon 1 and 2, and another way is between carbon 2 and 3. \n\nLast, chain isomers! It‚Äôs really just branching out the straight chain. Let‚Äôs use but-1-ene (double bond between carbon 1 and 2) so the only way u can branch it out is 3 carbons in a straight line and one carbon branched out and u get 2 chain isomers (including the original, the 4 carbon straight chain)! \n\nI use this method for JC chem so tbh i think the first step isn‚Äôt really that impt for sec sch but yeah!

If I may add a suggestion, it's probably more useful to flip the chain and position steps.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve identify the carbon backbone, all you need to do thereafter is to permute the position of the functional group.\n\nI think that‚Äôs easier than to rearrange the C-skeleton without affecting the position of the FG. You're also less likely to get repeated structures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing pentanol as an example (I‚Äôll be skipping the functional group isomerism):\n\n3 possible chains: pentane, 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylpropane.\n\nA permutation of the possible positions results in the [following 8 isomers](https://imgur.com/a/tWQhGxr).""]","[1585668444.0, 1585700757.0]","[6.0, 2.0]"

after a level results came out (i scored 73.75rp, arts stream in jc), i basically thought i had all the time in the world and didnt think much about uni applications... until the last week. didnt think about so much then bc i was quite happy with my grades until i realised (recently) that many many many people did so much better and i'm just one out of the many candidates. 

i submitted my application to 4 universities (big 3 + SUSS) at 11pm plus on 19 march, and looking back, idk if i made the right choice in terms of putting my choices. my application to the university had all the personal statement + essays for ABA/DA. all of cut offs listed below are the 10th percentile of the courses. 

NUS 
1) FASS (cut off 75)
2) project facilities / real estate (cut off both 71.25) 

SMU 
1) social science, PPS then PLE (cut off 73.75)
2) info systems (cut off 73.75) 

NTU
1) public policy and global affairs (cut off 75rp) 
2) sociology (cut off 72.5)
3) philosophy (cut off 70) 

SUSS 
1) public safety and security
2) social work with minor 

i see people getting offers left and right, and so far i've been contacted by SMU for an interview, and i dont think i did well for it. lowkey stressed now bc i'm afraid i'm not good enough to get to FASS in NUS, and that NTU will take extremely long to contact me given that i'm below their 10th percentile for my first choice, and idk how their offering system works for second choices. my friends who put PPS for SUSS have already gotten emails saying that they were rejected for PPS and they'll be interviewed for their second choice, but i havent heard anything. (friend's rp is 65 onwards). told my other friends about it and they were like ""aiya you apply SUSS when you got chance of going to the big 3, they confirm wont get back to you cause they think you'll reject them what"".

[Uni] [SIT Physio] Summary of Kira Interview,University :snoo_smile:,1585628138.0,"Hi everyone, I'm applying for SIT Physiotherapy, and just completed the video interview. Want to share a few things as I've seen people asking about it.

1. I only got 2 practice questions. I thought that they would randomly pick 2 from a pool and change everytime i refresh, but nope, only those 2 practice questions.

2. They say that there are 18 questions, but a few questions just provide the background for upcoming questions, so overall its less.

3. There is a 30min essay component!!! I did not expect this and was not prepared for this...

4. The questions at the start gave u a TOUGH situation and asked how u will react to this situation, what u feel etc.

5. In the middle there are 2 roleplay sessions. The roleplay basically gives you the background brief, and then shows a video of a person roleplaying(for me he was acting like an elderly citizen complaining to me abt an issue). You have to stay in character to your role and try to reply to him, and then in a next video they will ask you on your thoughts abt the situation. As a physio applicant, I mainly got more social services-type questions.

6. The questions at the end of the interview ask the generic questions, e.g. what are your strengths and weakness, why should we pick you, etc.

7. Some ppl have said there was a 2min time for u to write more things at the end, mine wasnt written but was a video for u to say anything for qn 18.

8. Generally the questions gave you 10 seconds to prepare your response, and then 2 mins for your reply.

9. I completed the entire thing in 1h15min.

10. They also ask you on why you picked your specific course vs other healthcare roles offered by SIT.

2) they have never accepted students from SUSS which can be seen [here](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/images/default-source/admissions/class-profile---universities.jpg?sfvrsn=8389ccec_0) 
3) the MCAT (entrance exam to Duke-NUS) is notoriously hard and SUSS does not prep you enough for it even if you self study 

is this true ?? can someone pls help me with this , because i am genuinely concerned . because i am now considering on taking a part time undergrad course at SUSS to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor too ??",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fs1b5p/uni_med_school_from_suss/,11.0,"[""he's lying through his teeth. duke-nus only has programmes with smu, sutd, ntu and nus (and yale-nus). Also, they're pre-MD programmes, not MD ones. and common sense tells us that anyone whose grades are good enough for med sku would not even consider SUSS, let alone a part-time programme there. there also isn't any time for simultaneous studies.\n\nfor your case, i understand your concern. there are many people here who have had the dream to become a doctor created in them either by nature or nurture. some succeed, some don't. for you, unfortunately, all the facts are going against you. i'd just like to add on that even full-time SUSS degrees have nowhere close to the rigour of other big unis in Singapore. Part-time courses have even less. \n\nYes, you may be able to do all the non-medical jobs that the MD folks did before joining the course, and yes, your work experience can be advantageous in the selection process. But above all, medicine is a very textbook-heavy course (at least at the start) and your academic standing has to be top tier to be able to handle the massive amounts of content that the course has. There's a reason why SUSS is called the uni of Self Study. The rigour just isn't there.\n\nI apologize if I sounded rude, but that's the truth I gathered from asking med sku department heads (overseas) and medical lecturers locally. No school is going to risk wasting public/donor funds on someone who has not proven his academic abilities. If you have money, maybe you could go an overseas uni, do a foundation year (and do well) and study MBBS there. Saves you time but will probably cost you half a million in total.

On the 4th of Feb , I switched on my phone to the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù of finding out I was posted to media and Comm mgt at tp ( which was my 5 Th choice ) . For a good year , I set my mind on going to jc ( vjc or tmjc ) and even though I really only started studying after prelims , I still thot I could do well and while I didn‚Äôt do that badly considering my worst grade was a b3 ( for 4 subjects lol) . In the end , I didn‚Äôt manage to get into tmjc obv? So I appealed into yi , still thinking that jc would be that hard and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm smart enough to get into jc what ‚Äú , so I entered yi and barely three months into j1 , I‚Äôve been more stressed than ever that I wished I stayed on in my poly course . I can‚Äôt write any essays , I can‚Äôt even think of how to answer my chinese oral qns , basically I don‚Äôt understand anything that goes on in lectures and in tutorials .

[Uni] Declare mental conditions at uni pre-admission screening?,University :snoo_smile:,1585575157.0,"Created a throwaway account for this.

I suffered from a mental condition in JC and have been seeing a doctor at a public hospital, and am on meds for it, but am stable and require no extra assistance. (Didn't request for special arrangements at A levels).

**During the uni applications, I did not declare my medical history** as I don't think I need special assistance. Also I couldn't obtain a doctor's letter in time for the uploading of documents, so I said nothing.

Should I go ahead and declare it at the screening, at the risk of being deemed disingenuous by the university? **Will my offer be revoked?**

Will it be better if I just never declare anything if I originally didn't, and count on never having a noticeable relapse during uni, so that there's no inconsistency between the application and health declaration form?

[uni] uk uni advice?,University :snoo_smile:,1585557216.0,"hello seniors who are now studying in uk/about to study there! i have a few questions abt the application process and i would love to hear several opinions as well!


so basically i'm a J2 in the arts stream taking H2 ELL, History, Lit, and H1 Math. I'm currently doing quite well in all my subjects. I have no H3 bcs I was quite busy w CCA (lol) so i didnt want to risk abandoning my commitments + possibly impacting my H2 negatively. I want to pursue Linguistics/related fields in the UK (another reason why I didn't want to take H3 as theres no H3 ELL). 

1. When did yall start the application process? I'm not from a 'top' JCs and not many (if any) Universities representatives visit my JC so I am lacking in the insights needed for the application process.

2. Is it realistic to aim for 'top' universities like UCL, Edinburgh w only 3 H2s? I realise not taking H3 and 4H2s are impacting my application quite negatively alr, although these Unis don't require 4H2s. I didn't want to take H2 maths as my maths background isn't so strong and I didn't want it to take a toll on my other H2s.

3. Do you think its worth the costs? Singaporean unis aren't so well known for their Humanities courses so I was wondering whether its worth the splurge to study Humanities in the UK.

Insights much appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/frn1ww/uni_uk_uni_advice/,3.0,"['Hello! Hope my answers help :)\n\n1. I started in dec because application deadlines are usually in early Jan. Unless you‚Äôre applying for Oxbridge, their deadlines are earlier. However I would say start as soon as you can! You need to prep a personal statement as to why you want to study that course and why you chose the UK. You‚Äôll also need a reference from your teacher so it‚Äôs best to give them time to write it.\n\n2. Can‚Äôt answers cause I was from poly :(\n\n3. Doing a humanities course (art hist) overseas and I think it‚Äôs worth it! Looking at related art hist modules offered at NUS/NTU, I like the ones offered at my uni more. I think there‚Äôs more variety and the topics are more interesting. The exposure to the art culture in London  also helps with my course. Additionally, my profs are really high up in their field and have several connections in the industry, allowing us to go behind the scenes of several museums. But I think it‚Äôs most important to look at the modules of the course you plan to do and see if you‚Äôre interested in them/think you‚Äôll enjoy it. No point going overseas if you‚Äôre not gonna like the modules imo.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel feel to PM :)', 'Hi! A fellow artstream student as well who applied to UK unis ~ \nYour school might have done a briefing on UK unis so they do put in place internal deadlines for applications. Generally for oxbridge you definitely have to apply early such as maybe even before Prelims. You can ask your school if you are allowed to apply later if you wish to spend the time focusing on A levels as the deadline for UCAS for most unis is if Im not wrong, January 15. Just always update your teachers as their referrals are important and you would need their help crafting your personal statement.\nYour CCAs and other external activities are definitely impt in your application so dont be discouraged you only take 3 H2s , my friend got accepted into the in UCL and the history course of Edinburgh and she only took 3H2s. \n\nAlso, whether it is worth it honestly depends on your own self. Sg unis are good enough, truly and thats what made me decide to stay here in Sg in the end. Sg unis have many scholarships to help lighten the load. For now, try to search up scholarships that you could potentially apply for to help lighten the financial burden of studying in the UK ! Studying abroad is definitely a wonderful experience but you‚Äôd want to be practical and confirm if your parents are onboard etc', 'Hi! I got offered for UCL (amongst other schools) for linguistics! It‚Äôs very exciting to see another linguistics student-to-be :-) The other answers give good general advice so mine‚Äôs more specific to linguistics.\n\n1. I think sufficiently answered by all the other comments!\n\n2. Since universities like UCL and Edinburgh will only need 3H2s to assess their conditional offer you should be fine with 3H2s! The downside is that you need to score well in all of your H2s and don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù H2 to swap out. In fact I think linguistics isn‚Äôt that competitive a course because all my linguistics conditional offers were AAB, so as long as your UCAS statement is reasonable and you have a good teacher reference I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so competitive that they‚Äôd disadvantage you for being 3H2. The UK schools really don‚Äôt look at your extracurriculars at all, so it‚Äôs a bit strange that the other comments said so. If anything, CCAs only matter for US applications. \n\n3. Look at the courses and specialisation you want in linguistics carefully, and match the schools based on it! I personally didn‚Äôt apply to Oxbridge because (from what I understand on the website) they are very anglocentric and theoretical in their type of linguistic focus (and Oxford doesn‚Äôt even offer it on its own because its combined with Philosophy and Psychology), whereas I wanted to do more applied and quantitative linguistics (computational, experimental, etc) especially in East Asian languages. For this UCL has an Experimental Linguistics course so it suited me perfectly. Locally NTU was a better choice for me because their LMS course covers a wider range of languages and leans towards applied fields, whereas NUS‚Äô only focuses on English linguistics. Edinburgh is a top school for linguistics but it is a straight 4 year MA Linguistics course, so I didn‚Äôt apply for it because I would hope to do an MA in another country.\n\nSo between studying here and overseas, maybe if your specialisation is something that can only be pursued overseas that gives you an easier answer. For instance if you‚Äôre into corpus linguistics Edinburgh has a whole research lab on it while NTU only has one module. There‚Äôs also a question of faculty‚Äîmaybe there‚Äôs a prof at UCL who does research in the area you‚Äôre interested in, but no such profs at NTU. That‚Äôs very important because your profs determine the kind of niche classes you can be exposed to and the kind of undergrad research you can do. For instance I‚Äôm very interested in sign language linguistics and UCL has one faculty with it as their specific research area, and they also have one faculty from Japan who could be a great advisor if I want to do a thesis in East Asian/Japanese languages.\n\nAlso of course, the general appeal of living overseas and learning independence, as the other comments have mentioned.', ""1. I think most schools have powerpoint slides on their website with the timeline for US/UK applications that are available to the public. For oxbridge the deadline is sep/oct for the rest is jan\n2. Yea go for it, as you said 4H2s is not a requirement. You can make up for it with extracurriculars.\n3. I hope so. It's probably best to get some kind of scholarship if it's a stretch to afford it, but even if I don't get one I think I'll still go. Just live on bread and water lol.""]","[1585578916.0, 1585580829.0, 1585616932.0, 1585581916.0]","[3.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0]"

Not too sure if they changed it since my batch but ill just share my experience for the interviews here. \n\nFirst, youll need to do an essay. There were 3 questions for mine and a single A4 paper page limit. You can choose to answer any of the 1 out of 3 questions provided. The main aim we discerned after getting into SIT was that they mainly just wanna look at your ability to critically think and reason, which is extremely important to develop going into the healthcare industry. \n\nNot sure if this is still here since its online now...\n\nSecondly, this is the Multiple Mini Interviews(MMI) there were 4 stations for mine \n\nEach station you are given 2 minutes to read through a prep sheet and then you are given 8 minutes to speak. HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU SPEAK FOR ALL 8 MINUTES.\n\nFrom my experience, the following were the general questions they asked for each station(its been awhile so i cant really remember but ill try) \n\n1. General healthcare : they asked about how you think technology has helped the healthcare industry and about medisave/shield. \n\nMy advice: Read up about the basic healthcare system and how it works in singapore.Understand the general principles of the different schemes that the govt has set up for citizens. \n\n2. A critical thinking scenario : a story was given to me about being a patient and encountering a doctor that smelt like alcohol whilst talking to him. They want to know what would you do if you encounter difficulty in the field. \n\nMy advice: Go back to basics on your fundamental morals. Know your right from wrong and the gray in between. Empathise always. \n\n3. Course specific interview: They gonna ask u about the course you applied for. \n\nMy advice: know what an RT does. Know the main purpose of our job( ans: pain relief) and tell them why u want it so bad. \n\n4. Healthcare related: They asked about how the healthcare system works. Like the flow\n\nMy advice: know how people get from the doctor to the hospital and what happens after they get discharged. Like the entire process. \n\nFinal thoughts : tbh i didnt expect to get in and its been a whirlwind of fun and craziness and insanity. But i love it lol. Please think this through if u wanna enter this course because it is very very niche. And youll end up working in the field for a while if you choose to stay. As a year 3, I feel about half my class is ready to leave the industry as soon as we graduate. Its mostly a mixture of jadedness and burnout and lack of motivation.

so yea i‚Äôm just feeling q depressed and lonely rn bc i‚Äôm seeing how my other jc schoolmates hang out and gather together frequently on ig stories, and i‚Äôm rly envious of them to still hang tgt even after school & exams. it‚Äôs such a blessing to have a constant group of close friends to hang out with frequently 

don‚Äôt tell me to not compare because really, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that toxic / bad to be envious of others and self reflect once in a while

and it‚Äôs not like i can really ask my jc friends out because like i said we don‚Äôt rly vibe (and i cant rly be bothered to try too cos i know we can‚Äôt force connections) i still keep in touch w my sec sch friends but we‚Äôre rly just acquaintances who will meet once or twice every few months 

and for the very few 2-3 friends who i can rly vibe well with, we haven‚Äôt see each other for a v long time so it‚Äôs kinda awkward to ask them out and hang 1 on 1 for like a few hrs (it‚Äôs like a temporary getaway from the feeling of being lonely and that‚Äôs about it, kinda pointless imo) 

what i wld want is a close knitted group of friends where everyone connects well with each other and wld hang frequently (once every 1-2 weeks)? where we wld sustain a constant communication via texts, and u can rly tell anything to and confide in, not those friends who u know will be ‚Äúthere‚Äù when u hit them up kinda thing u know? it just hits different 

i‚Äôm also q an introverted person who takes time to open up, but once i rly connect well with u and open up i‚Äôm q fun to be around with (taken from one close friend of mine LOL) so ya i don‚Äôt think i suck at maintaining friendships, it‚Äôs more of the introductory making friends part that‚Äôs hard to me

sooo i was just wondering if it‚Äôs still likely to find constant non-fleeting friendships in university bc from what i read you don‚Äôt rly get to stick with the same bunch of friends all the time unlike in pri sch to jc, and coupled w the heavier workload, it makes friendships harder to maintain

However, remember that friendships are a two way thing, no matter how much effort u put in, if the other party doesn\'t seem interested in returning the favour, it might be best to move on and forge new friendships elsewhere.

"[O Levels] 189 for PSLE, 12 raw for OLevel L1R4",O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585466199.0,"Hello! I know getting a l1r4 12 raw for olevel may not be very good as there are way many more ppl getting single digit for r4 and even r5! But to me, I feel that my results are quite desirable and I‚Äôm happy with what I‚Äôve achieved!
4 years ago, I got a 189 for psle but I wasn‚Äôt feeling dejected or disappointed(probably because I was still too young at the age of 12). I didn‚Äôt study for psle and I didn‚Äôt care about my results and how i‚Äòve fared for psle. I got a D for Science, C for English, C for Math and C for Chinese. Yes, I failed Science üòê But I thought getting a 189 was good enough, until I realised that many doors were closed for express stream. A mere 188 is the least to achieve in order to get into an express stream in a neighbourhood secondary school. However, I was glad that I achieved 189 for psle, and not lower(if not unable to even get into express stream). I even selected the NA stream for some schools, just in case I couldn‚Äôt get into my first few express stream choices. I got into a neighbourhood secondary school(cop was 188). It was then I realised how badly I‚Äôve fared for psle(when I started sec 1 and my friends started comparing psle results). My friends had close to 200, even some with 200+
Secondary school was a fresh start for me and I decided to work my ass off to achieve good grades for olevel. Despite failing Science in psle, I had the opportunity to take Pure Science during Sec 3, surprisingly! I knew things were gonna be difficult if I took double pure science, but I took up the challenge(pure phy and pure chem) and I‚Äôm glad I did! Although there were a few times I felt like giving up and dropping to combined science, I persevered through and WOW like I have never gotten a B for Pure Science before but shockingly in OLevel I did! From upper sec onwards, I had alot of tuition classes, like ALOT ! AMath, EMath, Pure Chem, Pure Physics, English, Chinese. My weekends were packed as heck(with classes starting as early as 9am and ending at 5pm on Saturdays). I had many sleepless nights in upper sec and I drank lots of coffee to keep myself awake. I would always stay up to revise especially when exams are on the next day. I know, this is my bad habit. I love to cram the night before and I even did so during the olevel period. But this was the only method that worked for me, so I had no choice. I stayed up for Common Tests, MYE, Prelims, and OLevel. I lost many hours of precious sleep but I tried my best to stay up only when necessary. I sat for Olevel in 2019 and when I received my results 2 months ago, I was shocked to see myself getting a 12 raw for r4 and 16 raw for r5. A1 for AMath, EMath, Chinese, C6 for English(HAHA but glad I didn‚Äôt fail though), B3 for Combined Humanities, B4 for Pure Chemistry. I decided to continue my education via the poly route and is currently waiting for poly semester 1 to start in April.
What I would like to say is that, psle grades don‚Äôt define you(maybe even olevel too). However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt put in hard work and not take exams seriously. A quote I live by especially during olevel period was: Work Hard, Play Hard. It is okay to rest and procrastinate for some days, I do as well! Everyone is a human being and we get tired on some days as well. Don‚Äôt drain yourself too early though(advisable to revise part by part) 
Always do and COMPLETE your TYS !! Review questions that you made a mistake, clarify and ask questions if you‚Äôre unsure, NEVER leave doubts !!! Thanks for reading till here. To all those who are taking Olevel this year, or the upcoming years, wish you all the best and believe in yourself! üí™üèª‚ò∫Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr1wsc/o_levels_189_for_psle_12_raw_for_olevel_l1r4/,143.0,"[""PSLE doesn't mean anything.

I graduated from a local law school last year and I remember being in the same position as you back in JC.\n\nMy overall advice to you is to just follow your interest and try for law school! As clich√© as it sounds, **you won\'t know unless you try**. I know it\'s daunting because at the age of 16/17, you haven\'t had enough life experience and yet you have to decide on a university course - which has a bearing on your future. But life is a continual self-discovery process and it\'s all trial-and-error. And we all grow as individuals and our interests can change from time to time, so even what you want now may not be what you want say 5 years down the road. But that\'s perfectly ok! You currently have an interest in law and that\'s a good starting point for you to choose where to go. If you subsequently find that law is not for you, you can always change course or change your career direction. I have several law school batchmates who discovered that law wasn\'t for them and moved on to other areas (such as IT). Ok my point is that: (1) you don\'t have to be absolutely certain that law is for you before you opt for law as your uni course choice; (2) there\'s no way you can be absolutely certain and (3) there is always flexibility in switching out of law if you dislike it.\n\nI know there is notion that ""you have to be passionate about law"" before opting for law school. I completely disagree with this. As I mentioned, I believe that passion can change and that passion can also be cultivated. I also find that this term is not helpful to a young student who is still exploring his interests in life. What I do however believe is that law is a very vast diverse field and that there is something in it for most people. You won\'t find yourself interested in all areas of the law. But as long as you are curious about learning about the world or about people, there\'s bound to be an area of law that you are interested in. Because ultimately, there are many legislation/regulations on all (if not most) areas of our lives and economic sectors. For example, if you are like a tech geek who likes to read about the latest products and innovations and are interested in news (such as the dispute between Apple and Creative), you may like patent law. If you like a budding investor who likes to read up about shares and mergers (Grab-Uber), you may like corporate law. If you are passionate about social issues like s 377A or the mandatory death penalty, you may like criminal/ constitutional law. If you like reading about controversial issues such as euthanasia and abortion, you may like medical law. If you like reading about global issues such as Rohingya crisis, you may like public international law. There\'s just so many areas of law that you definitely will find sth you like! So I don\'t think that you shouldn\'t be overly concerned that you would lack interest in the law. \n\nBut of course if you are curious about how law is like - just pick up a law textbook. It doesn\'t have to be a law textbook for law students because the legal jargon might turn you off. You can even pick up say a Business Law textbook for business students. Or you can pick up a criminal law textbook (I believe most people will find crim as a more lively and interesting area of law). Anything you think you would be interested in really. If you are curious about the practice of law, you can take up an internship with a law firm. I think there\'s this Singapore Academy of Law JC programme thingy where you can shadow a lawyer. Or you can write in to a law firm - but they may make you photocopying lol. But that\'s ok because you get to see what the work environment is like. But anyway the practice of law on the other hand is different from law school and another beast altogether - I\'m at this stage right now (as a trainee) and it has been painful lol. \n\nBut that being said, I do think the study of law is NOT for everyone. I can\'t emphasise this enough - **if you hate reading and writing, stay away from law school**. How the law works is that the court follows common law (i.e. previous court decisions) or statutes (e.g. Penal Code). So you will have to read lots of textbooks, court judgments (which can go up to hundreds of pages) and academic commentaries on how to interpret statutes, etc. You will basically be a bookworm stuck in the library throughout law school. You will be reading, reading and reading. And law school doesn\'t just want you to know what the law is - you are expected to also think what the law should be. So you have to be prepared to read a lot to make an informed opinion on various legal issues. And you have to write a lot - like legal memos, research papers of 6,000 words, etc. Trust me, you will be fucking miserable in law school if you hate thinking, reading and writing and communicating. And this probably applies for all courses but especially so for law school - if you hate studying in general, don\'t go to law school. \n\nAnyway I just want to say that law school is extremely tedious (it makes JC look easy on hindsight). So you must be prepared to work your ass off if you want to go to law school. But it\'s extremely rewarding at the same time and I feel like I have gained so much from law school and became a better thinker. So notwithstanding the challenge, I would still highly encourage you to go to law school if you are interested in law!\n\nOk I\'m sorry Idk how I ended up typing so much haha. But I hope this helps. And OP, all the best in JC and in finding your direction! Just chill and enjoy your JC life for now. I\'m sure everything will work out in the end!', ""You still have quite some time before you have to make a decision. I would suggest that you take up an internship during the school holidays (this applies to nearly every discipline, not just Law).\n\nYou won't be doing much since you have little to no legal knowledge but you'll get to see the rigour of practice. Go for smaller firms because they're usually more willing to mentor you. Iirc, there's also a Junior College Law Programme that's open to JC students."", ""Speak to lawyers? Hit me up if you want an intro and connection. I'm surrounded by lawyers lol."", 'thank you so much! and also if i like the process of studying a subject like gp, do u think it‚Äôll make the tedious process of studying for law easier? i am interested in law, but the amount of studying, reading, writing seems a little daunting and scary ngl. but i also get how it will be rewarding after it all.', 'Haha np! Yes, I do think that there\'s a high chance you\'ll enjoy studying law if you enjoy studying GP! Studying for law and GP would be similar as both require you to perform research, read and analyse various differing opinions on the same issue, and form your own opinion and argue it persuasively. I would say GP trains you well for law!\n\nI also think it helps indirectly if you enjoy your science subjects. Some parts of law can be quite ""sciencey"". Because in many law school exams, they give us like a hypothetical scenario and ask us to advise a client. So we always have to refer to previous court decisions and argue whether those cases are similar/different to our given scenario and then conclude how the law should apply. I think it\'s similar to science cos we also study certain concepts/theories and have to apply them to our exam questions.', 'oh i see, that‚Äôs cool! thanks again!', 'are you studying law at the moment? in nus?', 'I graduated from NUS Law last year! :)', 'ahh I see, cool!']","[1585464839.0, 1585457817.0, 1585619406.0, 1585465624.0, 1585468728.0, 1585476544.0, 1585476592.0, 1585486212.0, 1585516894.0]","[21.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 6.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0]"

[JC] Rant about something's that's been on my mind for a while,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585412516.0,"
Hi, so I'm a J1 student and I've been enjoying my school life so far, having made a lot of friends (far more than I had when I was in sec sch and poly) and everyone in my class just seems really nice and friendly and I could get along with all of them pretty well. There's hardly any segregation into cliques in my class, so I'm really happy and grateful for that because I've never experienced that before in my whole life.

Until a few days ago.

Context: I'm the type of person to overthink things a lot and I've been trying to push it down ever since I entered JC because I wanted to be a brand new person and try to be as happy as I can be, but it's only been working out for the past month. My old anxieties of 'what if I offend this person' 'what if I say the wrong stuff' 'are they talking about me behind my back' 'did I say something wrong, why are they ignoring me (not on purpose, maybe I spoke too softly)' and these thoughts just fill up my mind and I slowly start to become more quiet and everyone notices it (because I'm quite loud and rambunctious in class and among friends) and ask me what's wrong and all, and I just shrug it off and smile again and everything's well again, so it seems.


These toxic thoughts keep filling up in my head recently and I don't know why. It's not like I've offended anyone (so I thought) but I keep getting the feeling that most people in class are sick of my cheery attitude in class and trying my best to answer questions in lectures and tutorials and it's really been hampering how I behave in class. And I want it to stop, but I don't know how to.

I'm really scared to voice it out to my friends because I don't want them judging me and thinking that I put on an act of being cheery and loud because that's who I want to be in class, that's who I want to be in order to feel happy. I'm hiding secrets, such as my sexuality, to them because I'm afraid that they might be homophobic (they often use 'gay' as like a funny term to describe a person's behaviour, and I don't really like it but I didn't ask them to stop either, and I just feel so shitty inside like I'm letting all of my fellow gays down) There're things that I don't fully agree with them either and sometimes I let them be known and I just feel like it's negatively impacting my friendships with them. 

There's a lot on my mind now, but it's midnight, so I can express only these thoughts coherently now. Thanks for reading it all, if you made it down here, and it's my first Reddit post that isn't a comment or reply to something haha. Good night! 

P.S. if you can give me some advice about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Thank you! And if not, thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqn8bg/jc_rant_about_somethings_thats_been_on_my_mind/,15.0,"[""I feel that the first step in forging new friendships is to be *authentic* and *sincere*, so as to let others know who you are. (not trying to say that you should share your personal stuff to new friends, as that's too early) Based on my various experiences, a real and lasting friendship is one where you can be comfortable in, talk and do whatever on your mind (as long as it's not illegal or harmful to anyone) and do not fear any judgement from your friends. (they accept you for who you are, vice versa) It's normal to overthink at times (I do that sometimes as well) but what you think may actually differ from what others think, so always remind yourself to avoid jumping into conclusions or you can engage them and find out what they feel/think, etc. (if needed) A piece of important advice is to have effective mutual communication so as to understand each other better and this will prevent any misunderstandings from occurring. Lastly, just be *yourself* and those who like you will stay and those who don't can just leave! (it's impossible to befriend everyone in life)"", 'i feel like sometimes, real friendship is also based off vulnerability; maybe you find people that u can trust? and i think it‚Äôll be better to talk to them, for they‚Äôll trust you if you trust them.', ""Ahhhh im not an expert on this but just wanna let you know that I've been at that point as well. The part where you shared about how you are afraid of offending others hits me. Maybe its just human nature to chase after transient glitters.\n\nAnyways, I feel like many times when we are going through such things, we often skew our sense of perception because people who feel they are unable to forge genuine bonds tend to seek it even more. What I am trying to say is, the way you feel they felt might not necessarily be true or rational.\n\nWith that said, should it be true, I think sometimes its good to self-check. Personally, I have noticed that people who are irksome are not those who ask questions in class, but those who gives off an air of superiority. I think if you love answering and asking questions, you are most probably under greater scrutiny, but I think you should deal with this not by shying away, but by being more aware and perceptive of the kind of vibe ure giving off either unconsciously or intentionally. Anyways, one way to get rid of this is to just actively help others or give others a chance to answer. I tend to only answer my tutor's questions when its left hanging or unable to be answered or when Im super excited and a fair portion are sharing their opinion, GP.\n\nHmm as much as I would like to share how the best bonds I have forged are through moulded or shared interests, I understand this is super hard for JC because theres only 20 people in each class. Also, I wont give the advice of how genuity and authenticity moulds friendship because, it don't. For example, if I have a bad-temper and I chose to be genuine and honest about it, sorry, it just doesnt work.\n\nBut with that said, I think that line has some truth in it in the sense that friendships are not formed by being overly intentional and it should feel fluid and un-staged. I guess at this point, its finding that one person in the group that shares similar interests and thoughts. You would often realise how many are also just trying to fit in while laughing at the 'gay' joke. Maybe by not laughing at it (which i always TRY not to), people would find you authentic and seek solace in your presence. Ever since JC, as much as I have made a fair bit of offensive jokes, I have rarely laughed or joined in jokes that I don't believe in, even if it is funny. \n\nFor example, in NS, I had a few buddies who do get bullied, but I have never joined in to laugh at them or mock them deliberately and I would love to think that that established my boundaries. The only time I find it alright and fun to mock them is when I know they are in it too. That actually helped me to forge deeper connections with my platoon mates and even among those who gets bullied."", 'agree with the many comments. awkwardly it isn\'t that everyone will like you for you/who you are in life. awkwardly i never had numerous of great/true/genuine friends in school life other than possibly ite period but outside sch, work/tuition/enrichment/kpop/cpop/game i do have countless of friends whom i can call friends truly(there for you/wouldn\'t judge you over every matter) etc. i\'ve always wondered if im the problem what not when i was schooling/younger. but humans are superficial, insecure, inferior issues. aka you can\'t ""please"" everyone & that was never solely ""one\'s"" issues what not.  \n\n1 always just ensure if everything is mutual if it works/doesn\'t work. like you can make efforts to make things work but if the other party really just isn\'t keen then forget it really. you know it takes 2 hands to clap in all relationships.  \n2 i def do agree being yourself/outspoken isn\'t that norm in my days. unsure about now. eg ""everyone likes a/b/c but you like d/e/f hence you are always being the odd one out etc"" / you have a mind of your own for opinions/aren\'t easily wavered by others to fit to the norm etc.  \n3 so long you did not hurt anyone\'s feelings / be it intentional or unintentional nor ofc not harm anyone physically or etc.. there isn\'t anything wrong. a great number of people are not self aware/even as you grow older/start working/adapting to adulting etc. ; so long you are aware/responsible/accountable of what you are doing.  \n\nthen generally i guess you are fine. society does make people introverts too : D üòÖ', 'i feel that as long as you‚Äôre being you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. bc tbh no one has the right to tell you what‚Äôs right or wrong. everyone‚Äôs different and unique in their own ways. if they start calling you names, just ignore them bc it‚Äôs not worth it getting sad over these people bc they‚Äôre not going to matter much in your life anyways. start finding a group of friends that you‚Äôre comfortable with and you don‚Äôt have to please everybody bc it‚Äôs not your job too. jus continue being you and know that you‚Äôre amazing just the way you are and don‚Äôt ever let anyone else tell you otherwise! ‚ô•Ô∏è', ""I totally get the last part especially; I've lost so many people by just being who I am; last time I had a great genuine friendship was when I was in primary school oop\n\nI'm just scared of losing them, I guess. That's my worst fear, because if I lose them, then I will have to suffer being alone again for another 2 years. I don't think I am mentally and emotionally strong enough to handle it again if I lose more friends when I speak my thoughts out 100%, so I try to think through things before I speak out often, in fear of offending them. It's so hard with that too, cause people don't usually tell you to your face when you offend them, so whenever there's a slightly negative change to my friend's behaviour towards me (like maybe ignoring me a little), my brain just jumps to the conclusion that I've offended her someway. And then I try to track back with our convos and try to find out what was it that I said that could have offended her. And that makes me second-guess the whole convo and I'm so tired of doing that. I wish I could try to care less of what everyone thinks of me, I really try to act like I'm insensitive to what my friends are potentially talking about me, but sometimes (like now) it fails and I spiral down a self-hate hole. \n\nI did try my best to be like who I am and want to be by being outgoing (because that's how I am with people close to me) and it was generally well-received. So I technically have no reason to be self-hating and overthinking things right now, but it still happens. And I really wish it would stop :(\n\nThanks for reading it all and replying, I really appreciate it!"", ""Yeah I get what you're saying, thanks for that. But it's hard to come out when I've only known them for about month or more.

For example, in my history classes, I often wait about 5 beats to answer the tutor's questions if nobody has answered him yet. I did ask my friends once about how they felt about me answering questions in classes (it's become a running joke in my class that I would be the one to tank the questions in class, especially history XD) and they said that they are extremely ok with it and even feel grateful, cause then they won't be called on haha.\n\nThank you for spending your time typing all of these out for me. I'm extremely grateful towards it and I will try my best to be how I was before all of these and hope that my friends accept me for who I am."", ""I guess I've hurt and lost too many people in the past so inadvertently, I'm trying to hold onto the people that I have now in my life. I believe that I have found a group of amazing people that I can bond and laugh and complain with and that's incredible for me, it's something I've never had for a long time.

In JC i was motivated to study and get to know my peers. However,they were exclusive. What shocked me is the fact that they created a group without a bunch of us to cyber bully us and mock us( i wont go into details) 

At first i was rlly shocked and affected by it. I went to school everyday thinking about their hurtful comments and i felt vengeful. They even laughed at us openly.  

I dreaded lessons. I rlly wanted to study and do well but the thought of them being there rlly made it hard to concentrate without those hurtful remarks circulating in my mind. 

What rlly kept me going is the thought that this experience will come to an end eventually. 2 years or 3 years will pass by sooner than you think. For those ostracised and bullied by your peers, remember to keep your end goal in mind, the A levels. Remember JC is still a place for you to prepare for A levels.

[Uni] US COLLEGE ADVICE,University :snoo_smile:,1585396802.0,"Long post ahead as I‚Äôm going to give some background.

I took my O-Levels in 2015 and got a nett L1R5 of 8. I could have gone to a JC, but I went to a Polytechnic instead as I prefer more hands-on learning. Back in Secondary school I knew I wanted to be a doctor one day even though I did not fully understand what it meant to be one.

I then graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with the Diploma of Biomedical Science with a cGPA of 3.429 out of 4. My GPA in year 1 was 3.3 and 2.8 because of a break-up which I regret getting affected by. In year 2 I decided to study harder and achieved a 3.4 and 3.7. At that point in year 2, I also started to receive more exposure to the healthcare industry and started to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a doctor. In year 3 I worked my ass off and got a 3.9 and 4. While I was in Polytechnic I participated actively in Clubs and Societies and organised multiple activities. After graduating, I also shadowed doctors to further my experience.

I‚Äôm now serving my NS as a Commando Medic and am now even more motivated to be a doctor. I‚Äôll not explain my personal motivation on Reddit, but I have a lot of passion for Medicine and it‚Äôs a career I really wish to pursue. As all of you on here probably know, 3.429 won‚Äôt really get me anywhere close to Medicine locally, even applying through the discretionary pathway will not help. 

I‚Äôve decided that perhaps pursuing Postgraduate Medicine is a better option. I‚Äôve gotten offers for Biomedical Science from several Australian GO8 Universities I applied to. Because I did Biomedical Science in SP, I received advanced standing and am able to complete a BSc in Australia in 1.5 to 2 years. Which means that if I decide to study in Australia I will be able to attain an MD within 6 years (I‚Äôll be 28). 

I used to think that perhaps getting an MD as fast as possible would be the better option, but I now have a different mindset. I would love to be exposed to as many things as I can during my Undergraduate years and do not mind studying 4 years Undergrad + 4 years Postgrad. I‚Äôve applied to YNC and am on the Waitlist. Hopefully they do offer me or I will apply again.

I‚Äôve decided to apply to US colleges as well as I do not want to limit my options. Any idea of my chances with these colleges? I‚Äôm interested in John Hopkins/UCLA/UC Berkley/UCSD/NYU/UWash/Gerogetown.

"[A Levels] sad and lonely, how to not dread school?",Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585393463.0,"hi! i'm really so sorry to rant here but i've been dreading to go to school and i really really hate it... i cry at the thought of having to go to school almost everyday. i feel overwhelmed by some things and this is going to be really long so feel free to read if you don't mind because i just need somewhere to vent :( i feel tired, not motivated, sad, lonely and many other negative feelings on a daily basis and it's really draining me out. my life really feels like a mess

i've been feeling this way for a few months, i think since prelims started in august. i have always felt lonely since then because that was when everyone started mugging hardcore for o levels. i didn't do well for prelim, i got 41 points and i accepted that because i was always at the bottom of the cohort and did nothing to improve until the end. i knew it was my fault and i was struggling the entire time. especially during that study break between prelims and o level, i was going for hours of consultations and staying in school from morning to evening to study on my own. some days i had one classmate who was there with me and i'm really grateful for her and i don't blame my friends for not wanting to study with me because i would have slowed them down though but i really couldn't help but to feel so lonely :(

o levels itself was difficult for me too, everyday i was wondering whether i'll even be able to go anywhere and was coming back home crying after every period. it was a difficult period and i was really excited for o level to end and have fun and all

but two weeks after Os ended, my family was supposed to go overseas for a holiday that we have been planning for since june and i was really looking forward to it but my grandma died the day before we were supposed to fly :( she died from stroke alone at her house. when i saw her, all i saw was a cold dead body and blood and it was so traumatizing. i'm still crying over her death and i feel so miserable but i dont know how to be okay again

the rest of the holidays passed by blurry i dont really remember anything, i was just at home and sad. results day came by and i was happy because i managed to go from passing 2/6 subjs to 5/6 subjs, which was enough for me. managed to join MI and was looking forward to it for a fresh start...

but i dont know. i really dont regret going there, i got into a cca i liked, i met some really nice people but im so exhausted and tired... like i said i'm really dreading to go to sch... i'm the only person in my sch who went there. the daily commute from one of the estates in the east to bukit batok is really really tiring and i just want to stopüò≠üò≠üò≠ i just want to give upüò≠ also after a month of school i moved to a new house. we moved to take care of grandma because she had dementia and some other health issues but she died before we could move and our new house is so near to her house (i can see her block when i look out of my house) and it makes me feel so sad everyday... :( it doesnt help that i still do not have a friend group and i dont really have anyone that i can talk about more personal stuff too... all my close friends from sec sch went to the same few jcs in the east and theyre all so happy and it hurts everytime i open ig and see them all together

i feel like i've lost interest in everything i hate everything that i used to like in sec sch like mt lessons pe lessons and recess because i dont have friends. everytime after lessons i just sit in the library and either cry or tear up because i thought of how i've never felt this way before in sec sch and i felt so sad... i miss my friends and i feel so lonely... i know its kind of my fault that i dont have friends because i somewhat isolate myself... talking to people has became so tiring and i find it so damn difficult to make friends with anyone... :( its so tiring i talk to someone for awhile then i have no energy anymore and i just give up. now during recess i choose not to eat too because i dont know i would just rather go lib

i dont know guys thank you if you've read until here i just really feel so horrible i've been crying everyday its so hard to adapt and cope and accept my fact that my grandma is dead and that i have a new school and new house and no friends and all these changes are so overwhelming for me. im so tired and i want to just not bother about anything but i chosw to do a levels to prove myself wrong that im not useless worthless hopeless like i think i am but at this point of time im really just really so close to giving up

tldr ; dread gg to sch, sad and lonely, no friends, new sch is alm 2 hours away from home, just moved to new house, grandma died, miserable all the time

edit ; i forgot to add but ive been going for school counselling for almost a month but recently my counsellor said that she suspects i have depression and would like to refer me to external parties. thing is, i'm scared because i have my own doubts and if i do get referred outside, def my parents have to know. im not sure if they really understand what depression is. honestly, i just want to talk to someone who can relate or understand how i feel like now, or someone who can share with me how seeking help for depression is like :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqi47p/a_levels_sad_and_lonely_how_to_not_dread_school/,130.0,"['Wah, i would have chosen poly route if I were you.

I don‚Äôt think you dreading school is a main issue right now; the main issue should be helping you feel relieve from all the distress that you‚Äôre having. I would suggest to find the courage and strength in you to book a session with the school counsellor to talk out your issues.

I did the same and was initially scared to tell my parents about what I was going through. I didn't want to be more of a burden I guess.

Grief is normal, and from your post, it seems as if this is totally justifiable, but i think if it gets very debilitating and makes you a low-functioning person, I would suggest to book an appointment with either the School Counsellor or a Clinical one. Grief is complicated and people expresses it in different ways. Seek your friends for support, and not for reliance. As much as many of them would love to think, none of them are equipped to deal with these emotions and worse, it might cause a strain between your friendships. Seek an expert on it, talk about it, and if it works, thats great, if it doesn't there are still many outlets. Depression tends to skew your sense of perception and perspective, know that the negative emotions you experience might be irrational and unfunded, I hope that gives you some sense of relief. If you need some support, I am here :). \n\nTldr; friends are not equipped with skills to deal with complex emotions, DONT rely on them.

[JC] recommendations for laptop in jc?,A Levels :snoo:,1585362442.0,"i‚Äôve only found laptop recommendations for uni / poly and barely for jc hence im asking here

the reason im thinking of purchasing a laptop is due to the covid-19 home based learning. my entire household has only one computer, and i have to share it with my siblings. my school has offered me to go back to school to access their laptops but i live so far from school that i think i‚Äôll have higher chance of getting the virus lmao, considering i live near a cluster and my sch is also near a cluster. plus its a waste of 2 hours where i could have been doing hw at home

plus i have many online assignments and its super hard to do them on my phone xD

Not sure about the price now. \n\nAgain, if you have any other questions, you can pm me!"", ""I'm using the Acer Swift 5 and maybe I can give my 2 cents worth. \n\nFirst off, it's definitely worth the price. it's less than a kilo, which still surprises me when I lift it up with just 2 fingers. Its got decent battery life, around 8 hours, but it gets dangerously low towards a school day for me, around 12-15% normally. Its definitely a 3/4 day battery life tho and you will need to charge it every day. \n\nPerformance-wise, I wish I took the RAM upgrade cause I really feel the RAM limitation while having 30+ chrome tabs open cause of research for school projects or while editing photos and videos (which I do as a hobby).  The 8th Gen i7 8565 version I have is more than enough for my use case, which I have mentioned above. There is no GPU, which I sometimes wish I had due to the extra power it would give my edits, but apart from that, I don't game much on my laptop so I don't usually feel the need for one. Again, your mileage may vary based on what you want to use your laptop for. \n\nThe screen is a solid B+. It is definitely sharp and very nice to look at, which the only downside being the color accuracy and colorspace coverage being quite average at best. (This only matters if you want to edit photos and videos on your laptop. For normal watching videos and looking at photos and scrolling the internet, it doesn't matter at all.) The biggest flaw this screen has is that it is not too bright, so it gets somewhat hard to look at when in strong, direct sunlight. \n\nFor the trackpad and keyboard, they are pretty good. Nice to type on and the trackpad is nice and smooth to use. It is pretty small though, and I wish it was bigger (I come from the nice and big trackpad of the 2016 HP Spectre x360). \n\nOverall, I would recommend it if you can fit it in your budget. Also, it is extremely drop resistant. Dropped it a couple of times and its all well and good, despite a couple of paint chips. The blue is extremely sexy IMO, and not much of a fingerprint magnet either. \n\nHMU if you have any other questions. I'll do my best to help you out."", 'The typing experience is personal preference. Personally, from the albeit limited use I have from a friends folio, I really dont like the short key travel and the overall feel of typing on it, even if it is for a short period. I guess you will eventually get used to it over time, but its not for me. Bringing a separate keyboard that is not the integrated keyboard-case negates the advantage of the lightness of the iPad Pro anyways IMO. \n\nThe mouse/track pad support again comes with the additional disadvantage of having to bring a mouse along with you and the iPad and your keyboard. That is not usually an issue with most laptops as the trackpad is usually sufficient. \n\nYour point of using the web version of the docs via safari is definitely valid and not something I thought of nor what the majority of my iPad using friends do, so that is a valid solution to the problem.', 'yep the keyboard folio is a pretty poor typing experience when compared to laptops but it does offer the best portability+utility ratio. \n\nAnyway the new magic keyboard for the ipad pro would solve the typing+trackpad problem but it‚Äôll probably lead to another problem of $$$\n\nPersonally, the benefits of the iPad Pro as a tablet (notetaking, media consumption) outweigh any downsides it has as a ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù but ultimately it is down to the individual‚Äôs usecase', 'Yeap $350 USD (or about $500 SGD) for the keyboard is a bit much ON TOP OF THE $999 USD (or about $1500 SGD) FOR THE BASE MODEL iPAD PRO. (No, Im not shouting, Im just on mobile and idk how to bold. If anyone knows how to lmk.) Now, the whole point of using an iPad is the note taking advantage. So you need the Apple Pencil too. Thats $120 USD (or about $171 SGD). Thats effectively a $2170 SGD laptop MINIMUM. Also, IMO 128 GB is not enough. It just isnt. I find myself needing at least 512 GB for all my schoowork for the last 3 years. So a 512 GB iPad Pro is $1300 USD (or about $2000 SGD) The best part is that you need to pay $150 USD (or about $215 SGD) extra for the priveledge of a cellular connection. That brings the effective price for a reasonable iPad Pro set up to be $2670 SGD, not taking into account the extra price of a cellular connection and assuming that you are happy being limited to just Wi-fi. You may as well get a solid top end, fully specced out Dell XPS 15 at that point, or heck even a MacBook Pro 13 inch if you wanna stick with the apple route. \n\nEdit: Anyone is free to double check my maths. All the prices are accurate from the apple store online (USA) as of 12.40 am on 19/03/2020 with the conversions to SGD being done at the same time. The prices may vary on the SG website, as well as any education bundles that Apple SG may have that may give any discounts, but really thats not gonna knock off much. Just a couple of hundred bucks max, and only on the iPad too.

[A Levels] How to score for chem,A Levels :snoo:,1585356995.0,"Suddenly thought of this because I saw an Alevel post on my feed lol. Context: Am senior who scored DESU (mostly s/u) for chem all the way until prelims B, Alevels A. Hated chem. This is how I achieved the big jump in grades:

For organic chem, how I went from not understanding anything at all to being pretty confident was DOING TOPICAL DRILL PRACTICES. At first I tried to memorise all the reactions by flipping textbook again n again, trust me doesnt work. What u can do is: Flip textbook a few times, make ur notes if u want, but after that, go buy some TOPICAL drill practice OChem assessment book (or ask frm ur teacher) and just do all of the questions for each topic. (make sure the assessment book has answers btw) (also make sure each topical practice has a lot alot alot of questions like 50 questions if not this method might not work if u have bad memory like me)

For the first few questions, its ok if u dk how to do, just refer to the answer and make a mental note in ur mind relating the question to the answer. As u keep doing repetitive questions, you will naturally memorise the reaction. This is how u build a foundation of knowing all the reactions/characteristics etc. Also MAKE SURE ur assessment book questions are really the very very basic memorisation without critical thinking kind because if ur like me u would be starting from next to zero knowledge when doing each topical practice, the point is to build up ur memory of reactions not to test ur critical thinking. Also consult ur chers if needed!

Btw the above is for OCHEM ONLY. For physical chem, u really need to read textbook and UNDERSTAND what is going on, not just memorise the answer structure n anyhow plug in values for different questions. After understanding, u can go ahead and do practice questions too (although I would say for phys chem doing alottt of basic drill practices is not that important, just UNDERSTAND concepts and do tutorials.) 

And ofc do TYS also! Trust me please guys because I really sucked at chem and this method worked really well. Jiayou for A Levels!

Edit: Also if your schools‚Äô lecture notes are super wordy and have unnecessary info like mine, just learn the stuff listed in the learning objectives! Don‚Äôt be like me and ignore it and end up memorising unnecessary shit (in J1 before i discovered it existed)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqa1lc/a_levels_how_to_score_for_chem/,120.0,"['Some good stuff here, just to add on: \n\n1) Organic chem is not simply, and simply not, meant to be memorized. It\'s also all about subtle nuances, as demonstrated in the sentence before this one. With regards to reactions, seek first to understand, and then to memorize. The things you should really memorize first, though, are electronegativities of atoms, and exactly how a bond is polarized (e.g. C=O, C-Cl), etc. Knowledge of Atomic Structure and Chemical Bonding are integral to understanding of org chem. There\'s a reason why those topics are taught first; ergo, if you don\'t already understand those topics really well, go revise them before attempting org chem. \n\n2) Understanding entails asking ""Why?"". ***You have nothing to lose by gaining a bit more understanding that will help ground your understanding of a concept and hence internalize it.*** You have, however, everything to lose if you just blindly memorize concepts without understanding only to be thrown off by some novel reaction in the A-levels which tests conceptual understanding rather than conceptual knowledge. Case in point: those who don\'t actually understand nucleophilic substitution reactions fail to realize how intramolecular SN2s (or SN1s) work; those who don\'t realize how NaBH4 and LiAlH4 are actually sources of hydride nucleophiles are stunned when they come across contexts which allude to this property. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for physical chem: \n\n* Contrary to OP\'s post, doing basic drill practices IS important and should **not** be skipped or otherwise glossed over in favour of doing more complicated questions. I hope OP was not implying otherwise. Doing basic drills only becomes important once you master the skills involved to the extent that you can read a solution for a higher-order question and not have trouble with the rudiments. Some still make the careless mistake of (2x)\\^2 = 2x\\^2 when performing stoichiometric calculations, and this is attributable to a lack of basic drilling. \n* Everything else OP says applies \n\nPractice doesn\'t make perfect; practice makes permanent', 'Which topical drill assessment book did you purchase? :D', 'practice', 'do you have any tips on memorising the reactions in the periodic chapters and TM?', 'lol are you from hc? cuz yes, the notes are really unnecessarily wordy, so much irrelevant content that simply the thought of flipping through is discouraging enough to make me procrastinate for chem :""(', '^^ Understanding also helps you remember the info better!', 'Actually im not sure cuz its my cher print for me one.

First of all, I m afraid that I might not make friends in my course and cca. The virus outbreak have cancelled all the orientations and cca fiesta and honestly it sucks and I m afraid that I might not make friends or even see the environment of the cca and school to prepare myself mentally :P

Secondly, I m afraid about joining new ccas. This time I m planning to join totally new ccas like being in student ambassadors. I m a total introvert that freaks out when talking to a bunch of people HAHA and joining that will be totally out of my comfort zone. But the main reason why I wanted to join is because I want to build up my confidence and want to try new things and discover new things about myself. However, the worry doesn‚Äôt goes away, and I fear that I would be awkward there and don‚Äôt fit in (IF I even managed to pass the interviews buhh) 

Lastly, i m mostly afraid that I might not do well in poly zzz.

[A Levels] How to do well for PW - from a senior,A Levels :snoo:,1585323034.0,"Hi guys I'm back, and today I want to give some PW advice to the J1s! It's been 2 years already, but I'll try to recall my experience as much as possible and give you guys some tips! As usual, this is not a foolproof guide to scoring A for PW, so take my words with a pinch of salt!

First, CREATE RAPPORT with your groupmates. For me, I was pretty lucky to have a few outgoing groupmates, since I am quite shy and reserved myself, so my groupmates helped to ""set the tone"" for the next few months together. I can't stress how important it is to have an amicable working relationship with your groupmates. When you guys have 1 disagreement, please please please settle it ASAP and don't sweep it under the rug. Cause when more disagreements arise, there will surely be beef eventually. Let me tell you, other groups will love listening to your group beef. And when other groups know about it, you will rant even more to them and become even more unhappy, when you could have solved the problem when it first arised! One way to build a good working relationship if you guys don't already have one, is to have lunch or dinner outside together. Try not to discuss about PW during lunch/dinner, but talk about other things. Learn more about each other and their personalities. That will help you greatly in the future. This helps yall bond, and when you guys are bonded and there are disagreements in the future, yall will automatically solve it amicably. 

Next, LISTEN TO YOUR PW TUTOR! At first, my tutor kept nitpicking at my group's ideas and we had to keep changing our topic. I think my group can't think of good ideas so eventually our tutor helped us with the brainstorming process as well. My tutor was so nitpicky and his comments were sometimes harsh, my group eventually became quite demoralised and it reached the point where whenever our tutor called our group, we would be like ""oh no now what"". But guess what! My whole class got A for PW and I highly believe it's because of our PW tutor. So whenever your tutor comments on your ideas, keep an open mind. Don't complain. Think about it this way: ""If my tutor did not tell us about this problem, maybe we will get B for PW"". Tutors want you to get A. That's why they can be quite naggy sometimes. Instead, be grateful to your tutor for taking the time to slowly look at your reports and find all the mistakes. Then when your tutor finally praises you, I tell you yall will feel damn good inside. 

Next, DO THE WORK IF YOU HAVE TO. For sure there will be slackers. And some of them will never change. But this concerns your final A-Level grade. So don't take the chance. If they don't change, don't waste time ranting about them to other people. Instead, do the quality work yourself. I know some people will disagree with me on this, and alot of people will ask you to tell your tutor. Yes, tell your tutor if you have to. But sometimes it still doesn't work. So tank the project if you have to. As I said in my previous post on how to do well for As, I believe in Karma. We all get what we deserve according to how much effort we put in at the end of the day. 

Lastly, ok this one is not really a tip though... So i'm sure 99.9% of you guys are thinking about how useless PW is. That was me I felt that PW was the most useless thing ever. But right, to be honest, I lowkey feel that actually PW was quite useful hahaha. The skills you get from PW are actually damn valuable. In fact, I'm actually using my OP skills I learnt from PW for my Uni and scholarship interviews now. The eye contact, the hand gestures, the natural speech, all that I developed from PW and applying in interviews now. So PW is not that useless after all.


Ok thats about it. All the best for PW guys!

[Uni] Am I crazy for not wanting to go uni?,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585320290.0,"It‚Äôs quite suffocating, I want to get this off my chest.

So what do I want to do? The truth is, idk.

Yeah, I didn‚Äôt do well for As (68RP). I‚Äôm thinking of retaking As/take a gap year while still working to buy some time of what I really want to do in life, but literally everyone advises against it.

Honestly, I dread going to uni. I applied to NUS and NTU but I doubt if I can enter with my low RP. And then again, I‚Äôm not too sure about the courses that I applied to. What do I really want to do in the future?

Right now, I‚Äôm currently working part-time and I enjoy my job. I look forward to going to work (didn‚Äôt felt this when in JC.) Truthfully, I would rather work than study now. My friend said I could be addicted to work from seeing the money roll in. Maybe because after 2 years in JC, I‚Äôm finally seeing the fruits of my labor. In a way, I felt worthy.

Hence, they get to save $, while also improving their profile.', 'Of course not, perfectly fine to think this way as you may find joy in working instead of studying but you do have to realise that a degree would offer you more options and chances for social mobility; right now maybe it is still alright as you are young and can probably work in any type of job but in the long term, when you are old, it is possible you will encounter employers who are ageist and elitist and seeing that you not having a degree would perhaps turn them off from hiring. Maybe you would like to think about the future, when you are older and need to save up to pay off bills and buy a house etc, going to uni and getting a degree may be a good idea after all. Just my opinion but all the best :)', ""I think it's fine to work for now, a gap year can give you more perspective. On one hand joining uni now can give  you more 'security' bc it feels like your life is 'on track' as defined by society in general; on the other it sucks if you get into a course for which you have no interest (something I'm facing now even though I took a gap year haha).\n\nI have a couple of friends who worked part time after their A's because no uni accepted them, so they stopped trying. They are now doing a part time degree in local unis, which honestly is really quite worth it i think.\n\nThey have 2 years worth of working experience and cash, they can get their degrees in 2 years and of course, pay less because the course is shorter. So quite a financially sound decision imo because they will still be able to get decently paying jobs. \n\nIf you don't feel like attending uni but u apply for it anw and u don't like it you will just have to push through. If you take a gap year and work, its fine also just work hard and try to get into a uni later. A good work ethic and resilience is important."", 'Hello! To be honest, I‚Äôve never really thought of not going to uni so I definitely don‚Äôt know much nor am I able to give you advice. However, I‚Äôd just like to say you aren‚Äôt crazy for not wanting to go to uni. If you just search on YouTube you can see people from Singapore sharing their ideas and stories regarding not actually going for uni or also believing that a uni degree is not actually necessary. It‚Äôs also really great that you‚Äôve find joy in work (I find myself dreading it haha). Just popped by to tell you that I‚Äôll be cheering you on whichever path you choose to tread!', ""some jobs require a degree e.g. doctor, others do not e.g. a Grab driver.  \n\n\nIn general, ppl with degrees earn more than those who do not.  \n\n\nYou can also study at SIT in the future; it is for adult learners, who eventually discover joy or necessity in studying.  \n\n\nUltimately, it's your life."", ""I may not have much experience in this area, but from what I've learnet from my personal life so far is: Irregrdless of what other around you may say or what kind of advice they may give, at yhe end of the day, they are only tring to help you/protect you by giving their best advice. So once you make up your mind about your course of action regarding uni or work, stick to it.\n\nTldr: You know yourself best. So once you've made up your mind, don't let others' induce self-doubt or lead you to change your mind. Its your life afterall."", ""No i think u are really sane and courageous to go down this path. It isn't easy going down an unconventional route but u still did it anyways. I feel like u will be able to reap many benefits by taking a gap year. Reason being is that not only u will have to be able to be independent, u will also gain some maturity and see how the society works at the same time. And through such experiences i feel that u will be more certain and ready to chase ur dreams and do well in uni. The point about uni is not about the degree u have but what u are able to offer to the table for ur employer. Since everyone has a degree, what makes u a more deserving candidate as compared to another applicant? And through gaining some exposure/experience by taking a gap year, u will be able to gain some invaluable skills that will come in handy in the future when trying to secure a job. All the best and hats off to you for taking this route!"", ""I second what other commentors have said. I feel that you haven't found your passion.

I‚Äôm also quite iffy about going to Uni bcos my grades aren‚Äôt that great, but it‚Äôs kind of stressful having difficulties finding jobs that I like AND have the skills for bcos jc obviously doesn‚Äôt equip u with anything useful \n\nSo yea not wanting to go to Uni isn‚Äôt crazy per say but u‚Äôll have lesser choices ah cos ultimately qualification is impt here & as jc ppl we aren‚Äôt very useful.

Hit me up if you want some personalized tips, I coach students on such things in my free time."", ""Hello! Initially I didn't want to pursue a degree cause I honestly dreaded studying and I also got rejected by the top 3 universities. When I tried to apply a full-time job with my diploma, it was really hard. Many of the companies want years of experience, or a min degree cert. Realistically, you can survive without a degree but you might not have that many job opportunities, and you'll have a lower starting pay. If you're unsure of what to do now, I'd recommend taking a gap year to try out different jobs, and be open to new experiences.

So to answer your question for the CCA schedule it's quite infrequent so commitment for the CCA is not very high (its not like other CCAs where u have activities every single week), also note that in year 3 you basically have nothing much to do cuz most of the club activities are for year 1s and 2s...\n\nAs for EXCOs they're in charge of planning for the camps and other stuff related to SCL (Freshmen Orientation is one of them) so im pretty sure they have meetings at least once a week?

Would it be more advisable to pursue a more generic/common double degree in Business and Information Systems at SMU or pursue a more niche career such as ASD in SUTD? Personally, I‚Äôm interested in both subjects but I‚Äôm afraid about the career prospects if I decide to pursue ASD in SUTD. Additionally, I‚Äôve heard that Business and Information Systems would be a more lucrative career path than ASD, where salaries may be more polarised as junior architects/designers earn a hugely significant lesser amount than the senior architects. It‚Äôs also a more risky venture as design is subjective and I feel like ASD would be a lot of effort into a project that may not interest me? Also, I may not have much autonomy in terms of design in an ASD-related career.

However, for Business and Information Systems, I‚Äôm worried about the competitiveness of the industry as the Finance sector is inevitably one of the most competitive industries out there with many people better than you. So i‚Äôm really torn between these two career choices.

[Poly] Maintaining a gpa above 3.85,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585218889.0,"I‚Äôve been really set on going to jc because people told me it‚Äôs easier to get into Uni. However, looking at how difficult jc is and how many jc students have and are breaking down because of jc, I really don‚Äôt know if I should go there. 

I also heard going to poly provides one more time to build one‚Äôs portfolio. 

I hence wanna ask poly students what did you do to maintain a high GPA? How did you fare as compared to your o levels? Did you have as much time as you expected to build your portfolio and revise for your exams/finish your projects? Was it stressful for you because you felt that you need to ace ALL exams in poly?

Thanks for reading and I hope you have a nice day:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fp9b30/poly_maintaining_a_gpa_above_385/,15.0,"[""Graduated with a GPA of 3.80 which is slightly under what you are aiming for but here's what I gathered over my 3 years (I'm from a social science course, so some of tips might not relate to what you are gonna study) :\n\n1. **Consistency** \\- At some points when times are tough (e.g hell week, multiple deadlines in a week), never give up and keep giving your best. It is important for you to read the rubrics of your every assignment to make sure you are answering the question and fulfilling the A-grade of each rubric section.\n2. **Finding a good group to work with** \\- I cannot stress this enough, having like-minded individuals in a group can make group work so much easier. With a good group, an A for group presentations and projects are the norm and can help to relieve pressure, especially if you didn't get a good grade for your individual assignments. Find people who have the same aim as you (e.g aiming for 3.85>) and stick with them.\n3. **Review your lecture and tutorial notes weekly and pay attention in class** \\- Firstly, don't snooze in class or lose focus if not it'll make your revision much harder. By right, even without constant revision of your slides, just by listening in class would be sufficient for you to have good fundamentals in your modules which makes studying for tests/exams much easier. Don't get distracted by your classmates or friends and just focus in class. A few jokes or laughs is fine but make sure you are taking in information from your lecturer. Socialising can wait til after class.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't say it is extremely difficult to do well in poly, it's just up to the individual to see how much effort they want to put, and of course at the end your results would be the reflection of your effort you put in in the 3 years. For myself, I was heavily involved with my CCA as well as outside commitments but was still able to get into NUS/NTU so time management shouldn't be a problem. The content (for my course at least) is manageable even with a very packed schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike what you pointed out, Poly really does help you widen your horizons in terms of working with industry partners and having more specific and hands-on experiences which can be good for your portfolio. If I could rate the difficulty of Poly vs JC (I went to JC for a year) I would give poly a 5/10 while JC was a 8 or 9/10 in terms of academic rigour. Just make sure to study hard and play hard in Poly at the right time =) \n\nYou can always PM me if you need more advice/opinions."", 'I graduated with 4 from an engineering course. \n\nFirst,  know what you want. If you want to go to top uni courses like MED, Law, REP, GEP, DPP ETC. Unless you have a very strong portfolio accompanied with near perfect gpa it will be near impossible to get in. So, just go JC as Unis are very bias towards JC students with high RP. I had my fair share of rejections(regretted not building my portfolio as well). Many of my JC friends got offer scholarship without interviews.\n\n If you have a strong interest in certain subject or course and know you want to do in the future, then go for poly. Poly is a great place for people who knows their goal as they get to hone their skills and gain knowledge in their field earlier on. You will be able to learn relevant hard/soft skills and build a strong portfolio for your career. \n\nIf you want to just get into local Unis then I believe both JC or poly is fine depending on your style. If you are strong in your academics, like to cramp your head and let 1 exam determine your life then go to JC. If you are someone who is very disciplined and committed, then go for poly as poly is based on cumulative results. \n\nI took a longer route, if I can, I would go for JC. Either ways you have to put in a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get what you want.

Sure the likes of NUS/NTU/SMU, the degrees will be very competitive and higher gpa will be required.\n\nBut not everything rides on a high gpa üôÑ', 'Fully agree with point 2, working in a high achieving group in my last 2 years made the projects much easier, as compared to my projects in year 1.', 'Oh what are unis still biased towards jc students? I thought times have changed. \n\nBtw what is REP GEP DPP(lol)?\n\nHmm my ultimate goal is uni so you would recommend me to go jc? I heard that the nature of the jc curriculum  basically renders students unable to participate in outside activities, unless you‚Äôre the high flyers. My main concern in hence the portfolio building if i go jc.', 'just curious, why do you think engineering is easier?', 'I‚Äôve heard the media courses are the most difficult to score because of its objectivity while engineering courses have the most straightforward answers and constant mugging will get you a high GPA. Is this true?', 'Ohh they are double degree programme, Renaissance engineering(ntu) and global engineering(nus). Basically there is no chance for poly students to take DDP and even med, REP etc take in atmost 1 or 2 poly students every batch.  \n\nThink long term, do you have an idea of what career do you want ? If yes, are there any poly courses that are relevant that will help you achieve your goal? Let‚Äôs say if you took on a course and realized it‚Äôs not something that you want, then it will be very difficult to do well and even if you do well are you able to proceed to uni courses that are unrelated ? (E.g business to engineering). Courses are unique, certain courses in uni requires prerequisite from poly courses. So do your research well. I have seen many of my friends that went for something that they did not like and graduatedwith poor gpa. \n\nI can‚Äôt speak much for JC curriculum. \nIn terms poly curriculum, a lot of free time (subjected to courses) to chill, mingle with your friends and participate in your interest group, I believe that it is definitely plentiful. Depending on your course and timetable, you might not even need to attend school on some days. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, exams are easier than JC unless you take advance modules.

What if i‚Äôm taking a minor? does that mean i cannot go for double specialisation?

Of course, I've had many friends who went from S to A through last minute mugging, but that's in my school (RI) and these people really have the ability to cram super last minute. For A levels to be a breeze, you need to get your foundation solid. It's okay to not mug as hard as your classmates so long you can keep up with the teacher and make sure you do your work consistently. Sometimes making sure you understand something is so much more important than blindly repeating doing practice questions without really understanding the method.\n\nI think at this point you should focus on getting your content down, not necessarily at the expense of sleep and social life (because those are important too!), and if you yourself know you're doing okay then don't care too much about what other people are doing.

Hi! Just a J1 taking advantage of the time now to ask this qn since everyone‚Äôs asking about uni :)
I‚Äôm currently doing science stream in jc. Coming to study sciences in jc really made me regret my decision and confirmed my passion for arts/humans, and I really want to make the switch when I enter uni. 

However, some of my friends have told me that it will be difficult since they‚Äôll consider students with more arts subjects before those with sciences. (Basically arts stream ppl) This made me feel really bad lol, and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs true???

Some context: I got A1s for all my humans subjects back in Sec sch, and A2/B3 for the rest of my subjects. I eventually decided to give up my interests and strength in arts for the more ‚Äòpractical‚Äô and ‚Äòsafe‚Äô approach->science stream (I didn‚Äôt want to fully dedicate myself to arts just in case I lose interest)
Though I‚Äôm doing a hybrid combi now(couldn‚Äôt let go of humans haha), the sciences are just taking a toll on me, and everything just hurts and makes me confirm my passion hahahaha :‚ÄôD

I know it‚Äôs still too early for me to think about this, but I‚Äôm very worried if being in science stream will truly put me at a disadvantage if I want to do arts in uni. Plus it‚Äôs too late to change stream and subjects now :( What were your experiences? Sorry if I sound dumb or ignorant

The thing is, taking a science stream would open more choices and you could still study humanities in uni but it would be difficult the other way round as many science courses require Math + Phy/Bio/Chem/Computing etc. while humanities courses do not have that many limitations.

[UNI] Questions on RVRC,University :snoo_smile:,1585201777.0,"Hi, im matriculating this year and I want to know about how RVRC is like. If possible, do offer your thoughts on the following:

1. college activities (what are the events the college holds?)

2. Y1 RVRC mods (are they good/bad/worth it?)

3. interest groups (do they make up a huge portion of the college's image?)

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fp67pt/uni_questions_on_rvrc/,6.0,"[""Hey, I'm an RVRC Y1 student so here's MY take\n1. We have extensive college activities. Some of them got cancelled coz of covid, but mostly we have q a lot. Events such as interest group (equivalent of CCA) fiesta, some movie watching in lawn, night cycling, dinner and dance and much others. Most of the events that happen across RCs happen here too ofc. \n2. So Y1 RV mods are basically GEQ1917(Replaces NUS wide GEQ mod), WR1401 (0mcs, just a chill mod) and Es1601 (usually replaces a language mod requirement). WR is an exception, so let's handle that first. It's a v chill module, just go class and play around kind. Only need to attend lesson (1.5hr) and just submit a reflection at end of sem. Honestly it acts as a p decent destressor for me, and also we do a lot of fun stuff like Kinball, tchouk and even went the temple at haw par Villa this sem. You can miss a couple of lessons if your rly cmi, so isok. \nGEQ and ES on the other hand, are much more tedious. I would say they are harder than the NUS wide equivalents, but more fun than them in terms of content (this is personal POV, look at content and decide to yourself). Compared to UTown mods, I think they're lighter workload coz they're spread over an year. They do need more work than 4MCs, but it's still manageable. Worst case just S/U. GEQ SEM 2 is project based (slightly similar to pw, but u can actually get money and implement it so kinda fun?). One thing to note is that the modules have been evolving a lot over the years since they're still quite new, and after a lot of feedback in semester 1 for ES mod, they changed extensively to make it better IMO.\n3. IGs aren't overbearing, which is exactly why I like RV. have only joined a couple of them and rarely go for them (I have other commitments in faculty and stuff so). I use them more for recreation than anything else, and there's a huge variety to choose from (or form your own, rv is q flexible that way).\n\nHope that answers it, any other doubts just reply here!"", 'Sorry for the shityy formatting, on mobile']","[1585214291.0, 1585214313.0]","[5.0, 2.0]"

I'm not sure where I wanna go so if y'all could help me out it'll be great thankss,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fosdbo/o_levels_poly_or_jc/,5.0,"['Personally, I chose to go to JC because I still wasn‚Äôt sure of what I wanted to do. Also, I don‚Äôt really have many practical skills or interests. I also heard that there‚Äôs a lot of group work and presentations in poly which I didn‚Äôt really like. There‚Äôs also this sense of familiarity when you go to JC anyways because it‚Äôs pretty similar to the system in secondary school. How you study is mostly the same, as long as you‚Äôre consistent and ask questions you‚Äôll do fine. The biggest different academically was probably that there was more critical thinking and applying of ideas involved. As an arts student, I hardly had to regurgitate or memorize anything, it was mostly about understanding. It definitely helped that I loved and had an interest in all the subjects I took because I was more motivated to learn and find out more.\n\nEdit: Also, the idea of being more independent and having to worry about how I dressed stressed me out a lot at the time. I guess I wanted to be hand-held a little longerüòÖ And I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs a bad thing, I think it‚Äôs more a case of how you want to develop more as a person, what aspect you choose to focus on and the way you want to go about it!

You can try it when you go for open hse. \n\nFor me I like technical stuff and realise that I have like network and pc stuff so I take up IT for my diploma. \n\nPoly do prepare you for work life. Poly life is like no uniform and also got modules to take. Each sem gt 6 module. You got projects and exam to take. You need to manage your work and deadline well. Sec sch your teacher will chase you but in poly they dun. Poly also strict on deadline too. \n\nYou can refer to the link below(I have posted poly exp) \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f39c38/poly_poly_life_and_gpa/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nIf you have any qns can pm me', 'Think of it this way: Will you do better if your grades are dependent on the final piece of exam paper OR do better consistently throughout your 3 years of poly education ? If you take a look at your grades and realise you do better on your final lap, then go to a JC and take Alevel. If not, join a poly and you might do pretty well in it! But firstly, have an interest in a course before considering poly route. \nI took Olevel last year and I have to say I‚Äôm an average student but when it came to the Olevel period, I was really stressed out as your grades depend on your performance for that piece of paper. What you do during the 2/3hrs for an exam will determine your grade for a certain subject. You‚Äôve worked hard for 4 years just to take the Olevel and nobody knows what will happen during the actual exam day(which might be a good thing if you do well miraculously, or do badly even though you did consistently well in sec sch).\nI personally prefer my stress load to be separated into different modules(which is why I fit poly better), rather than the stress on an exam paper. Do well for Olevel first ! ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'i chose jc instead of poly\n\nunlike many who chose jc bc they don‚Äôt know what they want to do specifically yet, i already have a course in mind. but sadly literally no poly offers it :‚Äù so i have to take As to apply for uni\n\nadditionally, im not rly a hands on person and people would say im a ‚Äòmugger‚Äô although i don‚Äôt study that much. hence i felt that jc would suit me better than poly :)', 'hello! \n\nafter experiencing O levels, I personally felt that I don‚Äôt want to waste another 2 years ‚Äúmugging away‚Äù. I felt that there was much more to life than just studying and I didn‚Äôt want to waste precious time JUST on studies. \n\nHence, I went to poly! I had more time to do the things I love (volunteering, music, etc) and I managed to have more time with my family as well. Not only did I do well in my studies (graduated with 3.99/4.0), but because I was constantly doing the things I love, I (unexpectedly) built a portfolio that looks really good on paper which helps me to get scholarships, enter top unis (better than our local unis), and many more. \n\nAnd I personally felt that I wouldn‚Äôt do well in JC because I can‚Äôt wrap my head around the concept of studying so hard for 1.5 years to have your next 4 years determined by one single examination - this concept stresses me out. But it really differs from people to people! \n\nif you‚Äôre the type of student who prefers to chiong last min and just do well for major examinations - then JC really will be more suitable for you. \n\nThe biggest misconception about poly is that ‚Äúit is easier than JC‚Äù. Poly requires you to be good at everything you study because everything affects your GPA. Once you screw up, your perfect GPA is gone. And you can‚Äôt choose to ‚Äúfocus‚Äù on certain subjects just like how you did in secondary school because you basically need to be an all rounder and be consistent. \n\nJCs and Polys are both tough - the most impt thing is finding the school that suits u best. I had friends who quit poly and went to JC because they really can‚Äôt do well in poly, and they did really well in JC! \n\nI recalled SP has a website which sorts of help u figure out which course is most suitable for you! You can try to find it. \n\nIf not, you can always do personality tests and see what kind of jobs suit your personality. From there, you can try to figure out what kind of course u should choose to pursue. \n\nThink about your interests then think about your strengths and weaknesses! hopefully, your strengths could compliment the course you‚Äôre interested in!

1) Are the MDTs tasks each similar to previous years or the tasks given vary to a large extent?

2) There are supposed to be Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI). This year, the interview section is 1 hour consisting of 2 stations. Is this the norm? or does the MMI contain more stations and longer duration in previous years?
Also, are there any group interviews conducted...? 

3) which component, interview or MDT has a greater weight in determining one's acceptance?

I did relatively well academically, and ended up doing law at university, something entirely different. I have plenty of poly friends who ended up doing something completely different from what they have studied in poly either at work or in university. My point is that there are very very few successful examples of people who know exactly what they want to do for the rest of their lives at the young age of 17. If you have just started JC, there is possibly still the option of transferring to a poly within your same batch since poly starts later. Look around at the courses and see what piques your interests. Talk to some seniors to find out about their experiences. But I would caveat that if going to a university is your ultimate goal, JC is still the faster and easier route. Make sure that you are not just afraid of the new JC environment and therefore think that the grass is greener on the other side.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more important to think about the subjects you enjoy, and whether you see yourself making a living with the skills picked up from studying these subjects. \n\nIf you‚Äôre currently in the science stream and you dont find any joy in it, you could consider asking for a switch to the arts stream (if its too late to switch, you can consider dropping a science subject to a H1) and vice versa. \n\nGiven that you did well for O levels, youre clearly academically inclined, and perhaps it was easier to study hard for Os since the goal was simple ‚Äî to get into a good jc.

As one of the commenters mentioned elimination is one way to do it but for me what worked was being able to reflect on what I liked and what I was passionate about.

If you really think about it, you probably didn‚Äôt have a direction in life back in secondary school too and that actually didn‚Äôt trigger your feelings of being lost and stressed.

It‚Äôs perfectly normal to feel lost atm and ill also argue that it‚Äôs good that you are thinking about this atm rather than having this thoughts perhaps after A levels (or worse during Uni üò±üò±)\n\nExcellent thing about being in JC is that you have the chance to take part in competitions (robotics, business case studies etc. etc) Don‚Äôt narrow it down to the major CCAs JC has but instead, look into the various interest groups and see if anything sparks your interests. If they are affected by covid (which i think wouldn‚Äôt be the case cuz these discussions could be done online and wouldn‚Äôt impact such competitions severely), you can look at taster Uni courses that are provided in Coursera and see what seems to spark your interests. Hopefully, it can further narrow down your interests and start looking at other opportunities present both within School CCAs or elsewhere to further build on it. i do understand that it can get overwhelming with JC work But it‚Äôs not impossible!

In fact it is the same whenever u transit from one institution to the next. Your certs and grades from the previous institution is merely your entry ticket for the next one. \n\nSo I would say you shouldn‚Äôt set expectations for your current grades based on what you got for Os. It is really not related in anyway. The game plan for As is completely different from Os. Unlike Os where there was a teacher/ mentor to push you and chase you As is really a matter of depending on yourself and your initiative to get better grades. And such a huge transition can be stressful. \n\nYou want to clarify doubts; you have to fix appointments with your teachers after school and make sure your doubts are clarified \n\nYou want extra practise apart from the given material; you have to source for it from your seniors/ Teachers \n\nYou want to be able to reflect holistic performance in your SGC (Your graduation cert); you have to manage your time efficiently.\n\nThere really is a lot of you involved so it is not going to easy and it is okay to be stressed. It is very normal. There are two types of people; people like me who have in to the immense stress and are now having regrets or people who worked with others and found a way to manage their stress. (I really hope you would be the latter type m8...)\n\nTo manage your stress I would say firstly stick with your friends throughout the journey. It is tough and it is draining and the only way you can come out of it sane is through the support of your comrades aka your fitness. \nDon‚Äôt compare results. Really comparing results with one another just makes it more stressful. It made it really intolerable for me to see my friends scoring more marks than me cos I considered it a defeat. Each and every person is different in a positive manner and it helps to acknowledge that. By doing so you wouldn‚Äôt find it that bad when your friends score higher than you; Nor would you look down on people who score lower than you.\nEngage in some relaxing hobby. Yoga, Cycling, hitting the gym whatever that is out of the school hectic life just engage in it while you can during your free time. \nAnd lastly sleep more.

So apparently, I received my GPA and it has dropped. It is due to mainly my group projects and hundred percent it was my group project.

Moreover, there was an serious issue which I felt like not to work with them again. I had asked another guy in my class to have him in his group project. but he said he will stick to his original team There were so many issues and I was shocked when one of them marked me down. That was unnecessary because I asked the group when to meet them on the next day I came back. Everyone were like we meet one week before school reopens. Fking hell.  This was for Module A

Then for module B, I disagreed with the idea but it was too late and they did not even tell me what were they making. When I saw the prototype,my heart sank. It was something they would not accept.

Moreover, for module A, I was only told in study week and they did not even tell me. Fking hell man. I could have done even better.

What is even worse is that they keep mocking people/other groups for meeting up regularly. The fact is the other groups met up frequently to discuss and did much better.

[O Levels] JC DSA - my concerns and questions,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585131043.0,"Hi, I‚Äôm a sixteen year old scholar from an ASEAN country who‚Äôs currently studying in Sec 4, and I‚Äôm hoping to apply for DSA to different JCs.

The thing is, before I came to Singapore, I had a lot of achievements in arts and academics. However, during my first year in SG (Sec 3), I did terribly in school. My L1R5 was always above 20, even in End Of Year exams. I had depression and anxiety and other mental health problems which also gave a lot of people an impression that I wasn‚Äôt a positive/willing learner. However, after getting more settled down in SG and learning from my mistakes last year, I believe I‚Äôm a much happier & better person now. I‚Äôve also gotten significantly improved results in CA1, and received a lot of positive comments from my guardian, Teachers and friends throughout the term.

However, when I decided to apply for DSA‚Äôs this year, my biggest concern was that I did not do well in Sec 3. I was so naive and pessimistic and did not sign myself up for any leadership positions/ extra curriculars such as SecExco. I really regret my attitude and choices last year, as they are now a huge disadvantage to me. 

So my questions are,

1. If I‚Äôm just a normal member of my CCA (I‚Äôm from choir), but my CCA has achieved distinction in SYF and performed in the Esplanade hall, is there a chance of me being accepted (or even shortlisted) for DSA? I cannot play the piano or any instrument, but I am confident about my singing and techniques.

2. Will my Sec 3 results have very negative affects on my impression? If I do really well in MYE this year, could I possibly have a chance at DSA?

3. Are my past achievements in my country applicable? (Will they look at these past achievements and take them into account?) 

I‚Äôm very insecure and anxious because all my friends who are applying for DSA are also extremely outstanding, and no scholar from my country has ever gotten into a JC through DSA.

OP, if you don't have a strong inclination in terms of course content, you should definitely consider the pedagogical approaches, community lifestyle, and degree of flexibility you want from your uni education.\n\n*Pedagogical approaches* \\- not sure how SMU's seminars work. Yale-NUS uses small-group seminars and starts all students off with a Common Curriculum. The common curriculum is very broad and has the cool effect of provoking so many perspectives from texts that everyone in the College has read, and it's an interesting look at how we as a species try to understand and rationalize the world(s) around us. Things like communication and presentation skills are taught in the process of studying the Common Curriculum instead of taking the front seat. I like it, but it's not for eveyone.\n\n*Community lifestyle* \\- Yale-NUS is a small community. That actually makes the social atmosphere very intense - everyone recognizes everyone else; also, everyone living together makes campus very lively, but also has its own set of challenges. SMU isn't as large as, say, NUS, but when I visit SMU (as I often do to take studying breaks when I go to downtown), the vibe is very different and a lot larger than YNC. I'm not qualified to speak about SMU's community, but I'm sure they're different!\n\n*Degree of flexibility* \\- at Yale-NUS your major is only declared at the end of Year 2, and the common curriculum also serves as a period of exploration where you can figure out what you want. I came in a prospective computer science student but will now probably major in Urban Studies. If you have very, very strong feelings about wanting to take PLE, and specifically the PL in PLE, SMU might be a better option.

Intel i5 quad-core 10th gen, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD

However, I am not sure what computer science students do on their laptops exactly. Anything CPU heavy? The Air has very bad cooling so it throttles like crazy, so if I have to do CPU heavy tasks very frequently I'd better buy something else. 

Secondary Question for any laptop: If I can afford either 16 GB of RAM or 512 GB SSD, which should I choose?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fok2nc/uni_does_macbook_air_have_enough_power_for_comp/,5.0,"['Hi It will be best if you can afford 16gb of ram for your computer as you may need to run linux environment on your computer (which takes up a lot of memory). If you cannot afford to upgrade to 512ssd, have a spare hard drive in case there is not enough storage. Just sharing my personal opinion as I am currently poly student pursuing studies in cybersecurity', ""Am a comp science student in NTU.\n\nYes, macbook air is sufficient. Note that you should be familiar with macOS and unix tools as the school will tend to teach how to set up windows environment. Either that, or set up parallels/bootcamp with the free Windows 10 that the school gives you (check out https://onthehub.com/windows-10-education/). But so far virtually most of my projects have been platform agnostic (can be run on any OS)\n\nFor year 1-2 your main programming is basics in python and java which requires no particular OS and can run instantly (no stress on your CPU). Your code compiles in basically half a second. You might have to look for your own way to compile C, or use windows bootcamp.\n\nFor year 3, you may be doing more complex projects like web development, android dev etc. Macbook air is still sufficient but you might need the 16gb of ram if you're one of those ambitious groups doing huge projects. I survived fine with 8gb of ram! (I'm on windows tho)\n\nYear 4 depends on what modules you take. If you're taking machine learning specialisation, you will need a desktop with a powerful GPU, although the school does provide you with GPU clusters or you can use google's online Colab (what I did). So you can still technically survive without a powerful laptop.\n\nI'd say, go for it!"", ""Don't get a Macbook. Likely in computer science you will be using apps that are windows based, meaning you will have to run Bootcamp or some other alternative. It makes it more inconvenient and lowers perceived performance since it will lack the optimisations that apple has made. Just save your money and get a windows laptop with a -U processor."", 'You can get macbook air but the bootcamp is buggy like what u/Keanric said.', ""Maybe I took an easier route. But as a NUS CS student who focused on computer networks and algorithm, I never really needed any OS specific software or require huge computational power. It was instead mostly theoretical, alot of paperwork and provings. \n\nSo I guess it boils down to the curriculum you're gonna focus on. I'd say any laptop can survive the introductory modules of NUS CS, you don't need specific laptop with high computing power.\n\nEdit: I use MacBook Pro 13 inch without touch bar 8gb ram. Also, there was one module that needed windows. I booted it via a external SSD and there was no lag or any other issues."", 'Thank you so much!', 'Thank you so much! This is great info. I do actually have a desktop at home with decent CPU and GPU, so most likely I will go for it!', 'Just curious but what softwares do you need in CS that are Windows only? I always had the impression that Mac or Linux would be more suitable by CS.', ""Yup if you have a desktop at home go for the lightest laptop you can get. You won't go wrong with the macbook air.\n\nYou'll thank yourself when you realise you have to bring your laptop with you almost every day for group projects.\n\nHeavy development can always be done at home on your desktop."", ""Different universities use different software, and I have a friend in Thailand who is studying CS rn. He says he has only used windows or Linux and his course doesn't use Mac at all. Maybe it's different here in Singapore? I'm just commenting on with what I know."", ""Actually from what i hear and what ive seen NUS Computing students have; a good number of them use Macbooks actually.  \nIn fact from the opinions i have gathered they seem to say go for either Linux or Unix systems and not Windows.\n\nBut i think it doesnt really matter much at the end of the day so just go with what you have your eyes set upon as long as it has a large enough screen for you to view code, a good CPU and memory and not too heavy to bring around campus\n\nI am planning to enter NUS Computing this year ( Hope i get in ) and i already got a Macbook partially because i am planning to do some IOS Dev and also because i really like Macbooks' look and feel in general ( I was a windows guy before this ). And also because you can use a macbook to do android dev but not a windows to do ios dev XD."", ""I've heard about the convenience of having a unix terminal...

[Poly] Questions about SP Biomed,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585035361.0,"hi, i am going to be a first year student in sp biomed and i have some questions.

2. How are exams conducted? Is it just open ended all the way?

3. What is the workload like?  Is it possible to manage if I choose to take up a cca and sign up for a foreign language programme?

4. Is there anything I can read or do to prepare myself before school starts?

5. What is the environment/culture like in biomed?

6. What are some scholarships I can apply for?

Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fo1221/poly_questions_about_sp_biomed/,11.0,"['Hello, I graduated from SP biomed last year. \n\n1) I was in the cardiac technology option and we went to National Heart Centre for most of our classes in the final year. My internship was at CGH and NHC in the cardiac lab department (we helped to do ECG on patients etc.). There‚Äôs also no final year project for this option because the internship grade takes the highest weightage. \n\nMedical technology will usually have the majority of students in the course because it‚Äôs the most general. If you‚Äôre not into research and cardiac technology by the end of the second year, it‚Äôs best to choose this option. Lots of lab work for this option. \n\nBiomed Research is well, has a great focus on research. Apologies that I can‚Äôt give much info on these two options as I was at NHC most of the time in the final year and was not in tune with what my course mates were doing. \n\n\n2) Exams/tests can be MCQ, open-ended or practical lab sessions. Most written exams are a mixture of MCQ and open-ended. \n\n\n3) The workload to me, is not that heavy to the point of having no free time at all. If you consistently keep up with revisions, having a CCA and foreign language class should be manageable. If not, you can drop out of your CCA at any time because there‚Äôs no obligation to have a CCA in polytechnic (ie. it‚Äôs not compulsory and you can have as many or no CCA as you want). CCA might help in your portfolio when applying for further studies. \n\n\n4) For basics, I‚Äôll definitely recommend being very familiar with secondary school biology and reading up on human anatomy/medical textbooks will help. It won‚Äôt be easy to remember everything but you can get a taster of the things you‚Äôll be learning on. \n\n\n5) Not really sure what you want to know about culture. As for competitiveness, I didn‚Äôt really feel much of it. There‚Äôs no bell curve in polytechnic, so everyone is pitched against the grading system and not against each other. So stay hardworking, keep up with your work, and you‚Äôll be fine. \n\n\n6) Can‚Äôt comment much on scholarships as I didn‚Äôt apply for them, but there will be more information on this when you matriculate.', 'thanks for replying', 'is there any recommendations on books?', 'Is there a set intake for each specialisiation? Is there any requirements to get into a specific specilisation?', 'This was the one we used in Year 1 on human anatomy: Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131934813/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_sIgFEbJ0A149J', 'For cardiac technology, there will be around 10 students out of 60 (which was the intake in my year). This is the smallest class out of the three, probably because it‚Äôs very specialised. There will be an interview at NHC that you‚Äôll have to pass to get into this option. The interview is like a chat with the senior medical technologists to evaluate your personality as the internship for this option is very patient-oriented. Additionally, 90% of the students for cardiac technology will be females because female students can carry out procedures such as ECG on both male and female patients while male students can only carry out procedures on male patients. \n\nBiomedical research takes in about 1/3 of the cohort. There are no entry requirements for research and medical technology. In fact, all three options are based on your interest and most students get their first choice of option. The only thing about cardiac tech is the interview. \n\nThe rest of the students who don‚Äôt end up in research and cardiac tech will be in the medical technology option, which usually takes in more than 1/3 of the cohort.\n\nEdit: Just saw the SP DBS site and found out that biotechnology is now the fourth option.

"[University] Animation in NTU, ADM",University :snoo_smile:,1585031046.0," I am currently a year 2 student in NYP Animation, going to year 3 this coming april. After two years of studies, I am very certain that animation is what I want to do in the future. My mum wants me to go to  uni directly after graduating, and the best option we're currently  looking at is ADM. But to be honest, there was not much I can get from their websites to know more about the course, so I want to find out more about how is ADM here? Like, for their animation specialization under Media arts,

1. Will I learn a lot more when I go there, or will I just be doing the same things I did in poly all over again?
2. Is the lecturers good and experienced?
3. Is there more 2d or 3d animation things?
4. Do they focus on animation?

When  I say learning more, I don't mean like as in gaining experience, but do they go more in depth in certain topics such as for 2d animation, color theory, drawing fundamentals, etc then they did in poly? And if they  focus on animation or not, because I heard from a friend that in ADM  they make you learn a lot of things and there's no focus on animation  even though the degree is called digital animation. The thing is, the source is from a person who graduated many years before, probably before 2010s, so I'm sure lots of things have changed since then til now. I am  looking to specialize in the 2d areas more,(pre-production and 2d  animation) and my lecturer said that NTU has became better over the  years in their 2d. But i wanna know how much have they improved and  whether it is a good school to go for or should I consider other  schools?(If so, which schools do y'all recommend?)

If you don\'t follow the dress code, especially during exam period, you may not be able to take the exam. \n\n2) The pertinent school rules about RP would be the attendance and late-coming policy: \n\n2a) >2 lessons absent within a module without valid reasons = debarred from final exam = remodule (some modules only allow 1 lesson absent without valid reason before being debarred) \n\n\\>2 lessons absent within a module WITH valid reason = subsequent grade(s) is/are considered F grade.

The rest of the 4 lessons are covered by LOA (leave of absence, absent with valid reason). 2 of the lessons, even if you have LOA, are considered ""F"" grade. It can significantly pull down your overall module grade.  \n\n2b) 1 minute late for class = considered as late = lose the chance to attain an ""A"" grade for the day. Most lecturers do follow this rule, but some will understand if you tell them a valid reason (like train breakdown). The more severe lateness are: \n\nPartial = present during 1st (morning before break) and/or 2nd meeting (time between first break and lunch break) and absent for the rest of the day \n\nLate and partial = present during 1st meeting (morning before break), absent during 2nd (time between first break and lunch break) and/or 3rd meeting (time after lunch) \n\nHope it helps!', 'Hello!

Sorry if I sound overly kiasu haha but there's not much online about DDP admissions procedure and the uncertainty is really causing me a lot of anxiety :0

[university] is having a stellar cap really that important? (especially for business students),University :snoo_smile:,1584931284.0,"Hi guys! Tbh I‚Äôve always been wondering about this question since I‚Äôve been admitted into uni. I mean, everyone‚Äôs always aiming to get that GPA 4.5-5.0 but tbh a 4.0 would suffice for me (yeah I know, I‚Äôm so unmotivated ü§£).... Just genuinely curious what‚Äôd happen if I got a 3.5-ish kinda grade in terms of future prospects? Eg would employers still want to hire me and am I at a legitimate disadvantage as compared to my peers - if so, how am I disadvantaged? 

I know 4.0 is quite good (gotten that for first sem). But everyone around me is getting 4.8-ish omg the peer pressure is real.

My biz friend noted that he has a 4.6 CAP but thats the second lowest in his group of eight friends, and from what he says biz and acc tends to have high CAP. The reasons why it is so easy for everyone to get high CAPs in most FASS or biz related majors could be quite a few (lower workload/content intensity/ much more empty time table) but we are not interested to discuss here. You yourself have noticed that in accountancy ( you say youe are surrounded by 4.8s in your post).\n\nPerhaps if you were to be competing for an internship with a physics or data science major, you would not need to worry so much as it is already a decent feat to get a 4.0 CAP in such majors. But if your main competitors are in biz or accountancy, it will be hard to get past the shortlisting stage when everyone else has 4.6+ CAPs.\n\nIn addition, for certain programmes like SEP, awards or scholarships, it will be hard to get shortlisted when everyone in accountancy are having 4.8 CAPs.\n\ntldr; you are in biz, CAP should be impt', 'I see!

[University] need urgent help!,University :snoo_smile:,1584928557.0,"so I scored 86RP for the A levels, I applied to NUS and placed my choices as follows:
1. Law
2. PPE
3. Business

however over the weekend I've been doing some consideration and realised I would want Business as a second choice instead of PPE. Unfortunately I can't change the course choices anymore as the closing date is over. I just want to know:

- Is there a likelihood that I will not be offered a single course at NUS? (given that if I do not qualify for Law or PPE, I may get offered Business but because I put it as third priority, there may be no slot for me)
- Assuming I am not offered Law (touch wood HAHA), and I really am offered PPE and I want to appeal for Business OR I am not offered anything and I want to appeal for Business during the appeal window, what is the likelihood I will get it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fnbuam/university_need_urgent_help/,2.0,"['When u get ppe, u can just appeal to business no biggie', 'Dont worry, i think NUS ranks their applicants based on academic merits (aka their rp), your rank point is much higher than the 10th percentile for business so dont worry about it.
