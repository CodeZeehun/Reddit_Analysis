[uni] NUS Biz Analytics vs NTU DSAI vs SUTD,University :snoo_smile:,1586091618.0,"I got offered all three but am confused on which to pick. Got offered the ASEAN scholarship for NUS&NTU, and the global excellence scholarship (which has better benefits than the ASEAN scholarship) for SUTD. I have asked a lot of people and most would say NUS/NTU because of its reputation so I am really confused which to pick. Tbh, regardless of the reputation of the uni, I just want to thrive in wherever I am and Im kind of scared of the competitiveness of NUS' biz analytics bcs of the very high cut off.

[Jc] Why donâ€™t we have textbooks,Junior Colleges :karma:,1586088771.0,"my school only gives our lecture slides and notes, there is SO MUCH information, too much. how do you guys study. is it just me or was it much easier in sec school to study for exams as textbooks compile whatever is tested for exams.

I guess that's just how JC works. It kind of leads to the situation where good school notes make a difference/ good self summarized notes make a difference. \n\nWhat you can maybe do is look at what others have done when it comes to summarizing/ formatting their notes and maybe use that to tackle your own school notes. \n\nAs for good textbooks, well there aren't any history tys to begin with so I'm not sure if there's any relevant history textbook out there. I just relied on my school notes (they were pretty good, I really appreciate my JC history teachers) and whatever points/notes I took down during tutorials (which can help in answering specific kinds of qns)\n\nGood luck with your studies :)"", 'Local publishers dont really provide textbooks for A levels. Judt visit popular book stores around SG, theres alot of resources. U can head to library too, borrow reference books', 'simple answer: they do not make good profits with the time and effort spent on them', 'The best thing you can do for yourself for history is write a lot of essays and slowly whittle down the most important/commonly applied examples from your notes to be honest. Youâ€™ll realise after a while that youâ€™ll always be using the same examples from your notes over and over again for most essays', ""For history, I'm sure that there are reference books in your school library as there are for my school. Some will focus more on certain themes like Cold War and whatnot. Since JC is a stepping stone to uni, where there are no textbooks given to facilitate your own learning, you will have to take the step up to do so yourself, by borrowing relevant ref books and learning the content from there, if your lecture slides are not good enough or you can't understand them.\n\nMy advice would be to consult your teachers and ask them if they could explain it to you in a way that you would understand better if you're struggling in understanding the lecture notes. Personally, I found the lecture notes to be more condensed than what I found in ref books and hence easier to understand, but that's just me.
