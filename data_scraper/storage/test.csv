This is mainly for A-Levels might do a O-Levels one soon. Everything is for educational purposes only.

Some Tips - For maths, i assume most of pure is covered so you can start doing P1 of Prelim papers alr. For chemistry, its mainly organic now so might want to start learning OTOT using the notes that i provided or online one. Questions try practice using TYS. For physics, same thing try learn using lecture notes and practice with TYS. For economics, it depends, might want to start doing essay questions or even CSQ if Macro or Micro is already fully covered.

The amount of time you study is not a good indicator of how well prepared you are and how able you are to get an A1.\n\nFor subjects like math, science & POA I instead feel that a good gauge is finishing practice papers well before the timer ends and getting very high marks without checking for carelss mistakes, i.e E math paper 1 is 2 hours? Aim for almost full marks in 1 hour. Careless mistakes are weeded out with practice and a calm mental state (a must have for Os!) And by not checking through you'll immediately know which topics you're weak in!\n\nEnglish on the other hand... It's a tricky one, read model essays (and examples if u do argumentative) or read random descriptive words and have a vivid imagination if u do personal recount/descriptive essays. As for Paper 2, just keep grinding papers until u can get a high mark that is beyond the A grade to be safe. It's hard to study for English so all you can do is practice.\n\nA student can spend half the time on a subject as compared to someone else but still get an A, even if they both have the same aptitude in it."", 'emath- 2h to do practice paper, 15m to read the math summary book everyday and made sure i understand every single page since every mark lost means getting an a1 is harder \n\nhumans- 0h, i didnt do any paper, just memorised all the content 2 weeks before o levels and got a1', ""Tl;dr below for those lazy to read.\n\nIMO, for English, practice and improve on your level of understanding, be it for essay questions and comprehension. Underline keywords and sentences to help you understand certain parts of the text, and if you have to expand on certain parts of the question (especially for essays), do it. No one is stopping you.\n\nNot only that, try reading up on various topics in the news, or if you're more adventurous, read up to gain further knowledge about the topics that really interest you on wikipedia, forums or blogs. You may never know what'll come out in your actual paper. This gives you content to use for your essays, in the form of examples and points.\n\nLastly, I feel that this may be underrated, but fortify your foundations on the technicalities of English. I know that using flowery and bombastic language ie. 'I serendipitously stumbled upon my long-lost cousin at the market yesterday.' can attract the eyes of Cambridge markers, but without a decent foundation in English, there's no use for a thesaurus. Study and know the rules of grammar, like which prepositions and tense to use by heart, such that it almost becomes like a reflex when you do editing questions. Try aiming for close to 0 grammatical errors for every essay you hand in to your English teacher. Only then can you try being a bit more creative and explorative with your writing style. \n\nIt may sound a bit daunting, but with practice, it is possible to achieve all of this.\n\nTl;dr: understanding of the text, reading up more widely, and strengthening your foundations are what will help you score your A1."", 'i agree with what the prev person said but here‚Äôs my number of hours (pls don‚Äôt use it as a reference for your studies)\n\na1 chem - 1 hour a day before Os (before Os, 10mins per day every weekday)\n\na1 emath - 1 hour per week of studying before Os, but did 1 paper per 1-3 days', ""Agreed for the part on English.

This was what happened to me and I wrote  my worst essay (IMO) in the 3 years of writing either expository or argumentative. It ended up costing me my A1 and I got A2 instead. \n\nMath in general is mainly based on accuracy and speed. The only way to get better is to drill yourself, until you can work at a speed that you can do it quickly and without mistakes. For my Amath and Emath, I just drilled papers. Finish one? Mark and check for mistakes, write the mistakes down if any somewhere and do the next one. Refer to your previous mistakes, treat it like a half open book test. Your aim is to just not repeat any previous mistakes, and build up your confidence as well. I got A1 for Emath and A2 for Amath doing this.

[A Levels] Willing to try and help if people on HBL have questions (Arts Combi),A Levels :snoo:,1586057112.0,"Hello!

So here's a version for the more of arts subjs students.

I'm comfortable helping with History, Lit, Math and GP, also H3 Hist (technically we're not supposed to, but if you just want someone to bump ideas with on the direction of your paper, feel free to pm. Econs, man I can try but this is like 60% assurance, and much of it will be my speculation. 

The rest of the questions, esp like History essay question breakdown/analysis, it'd be nice to post here to make a whole stack! If you're shy you can pm, but I'll copy paste (lol cc) my reply to here.

Any other people who did arts subjs welcome to join :) I hope that even though there are no more MYEs for you all, and this coming moth of HBL, you will stay motivated and study steadily without burning out. This is such a new situation so honestly, can't blame you (and don't blame yourself!) for being anxious. Good luck!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fv71xg/a_levels_willing_to_try_and_help_if_people_on_hbl/,9,"['For h3 history, did your sch give u any tips on how to structure your essay? Am quite clueless HAHA', 'From a HELm:  just want to ask for study tips? \n\nHello! Wow okay, study tips are a very broad and general thing, but for the arts subjects, need memorisation, understanding and speed. \n\nFor history - make sure you analyse a lot of past year questions, get to know what question means what: ""to what extent"", ""do you agree"" ""evaluate"" ""was more important than"", all these have different nuances to the number of minimum points you have to write.\n\nFor history, I\'d say, uh, you can specialise but please, no spotting. (Cambridge threw us a Secgen question and first decade, then also no AFC) \n\nFor everything in general, I\'d say know what makes you motivated - for me, I like reading fiction, and watching dramas, then outdoors things I like to look at plants -> When I feel like I\'ve done enough work, then I relax to reward myself. This gives me something to look forward towards and makes studying less tough.  Also, try to do work consistently, don\'t spam papers because you can burn out, making you lose more time than if you just went slow and steady.  \n\nNext, I tried to clear all my content problems by mid of the year, talk to teachers, friends, re-read notes and relearn concepts if needed as early as possible. This is because if now, while practising you cannot do one topic then suddenly the panic sets in and you\'ll freeze up. Mark out beforehand the things you are not so good at, spend more time (eg . math OMG vectors please relearn it fast fast,) \n\nDo also remember to breathe. Yeah. Feels like a mad dash, but really a lot of things will be up to fate. Make sure you know your things all the way to the bottom. Understand the why and how, then in the future, any question can reapply your previous knowledge to.', 'From \'need massive help for history H2\': Cannot do SBQ, especially part b tips\n\nOkay, for sbq, I think the most important thing to find out now is where your problem is: 1. Not enough ck 2. Not enough time/not writing fast enough. 3. Cannot understand the source/misinterpret (also important to note if you have more problems with which type -> the text chunks, cartoons, stats) 4. Not a \'rigorous\' analysis 5. Not enough skills shown? \n\nFor the ck side, one of the best things you can do is get exposed to a lot of sources - there are many things the sources can show us that the lecture notes may not get around to covering. The first thing to do is to get your hands on the school prelim paper drive (link is floating on Reddit I believe) if your teachers haven\'t given. Because the ck for the sources will only be a tiny bit of all the content that you are going to be learning. \n\nRigourous analysis means being able to go beyond just paraphrasing which is usually enough to pass as long as you write quick! One of the best skills for this is ironically not your CK, since when we do papers often sucks that the CK we want to use appears in a source inside the set they give us!! Instead, the best skill is the cross-reference. Because the skills only need to appear once/twice for you to move up the band (like from L4 to 5/6) you need to display as many skills as possible. \n\nBest to find sources that pair well (usually from the support set one will directly contradict the challenge set, or be an academic article about the exact same thing, etc lots of possible relationships) after you prove the reliability of the first half, cross-reference back to that one while writing about the next. Eg. A, B, C are reliable (finish) Then in the challenge set reliability evaluation \'Source E says ...."" CR to source A, which is an academic discussing the speech in source E, reveals to us that the political considerations of the speaker in E make it less reliable...\n\nAlso, just practise a bit!! more, need time to develop the flair and sometimes gotta get lucky and be hit by inspiration about the source - like not just \'academic source\' but \'this institute is actually funded by the government\' - not just \'retroactive analysis\' but \'the anniversary of the event\', not just \'after the cw so the archives will be opened\' but \'this is the person recanting their earlier statement because now they are no longer in power\' \n\nIf you know your part a is fine, when doing papers don\'t need to waste time, just jot down the similarity, difference, explanations, don\'t need to write out in full when doing prac. Only do the whole paper if you have time, or if you need to practice all.', ""Tbh, not really! There was no fixed 'format', but like you just write stuff and then go to your teacher supervisor to have it looked over. However, you can write with reference to either samples that your supervisor shows, and according to the h3 history syllabus doc. Here's the link:\n\n[https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2020syllabus/9823\\_y20\\_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2020syllabus/9823_y20_sy.pdf)\n\nread the whole thing if you haven't! It's sometimes fascinating to find the little things that the paper is designed to do, especially the Learning Outcomes which did actually push me into thinking harder about my topic.\n\nThe most plain format I can think of is:\n\nIntroduction, \n\nLit review (expansion of the one you did briefly in the proposal), \n\n\\[start of content\\] -> maybe about two/three headers on points you are doing research, the multiple answers/facets to the historical question you created, \n\nconclusion (where you should be tying up any loose ends/synthesising as well as weaving in the limitations that you originally identified -> this good to link to a future possible avenue of research to show that your question itself doesn't just stop, but provides even more possibilities in understanding the historical context and motivations. \\[end of content\\]\n\nacknowledgements are always nice, I feel, \n\nand finally bibliography, and appendices. \n\nBut really, the actual wording and structure depend heavily on your topic. Background-problem-reaction (with analysis inside) would be the summary of my paper, I did a geopol topic. If like eg. my friend did socioeconomic/dev. or one senior did art (like drawing art stuff), your topic headers may be more of context-issue-key figures-controversy-public reaction stuff like that.\n\n If have more questions, can pm!

With the release of the recent results, my cumulative gpa is 3.9 and above. I am from an engineering course in NP and is currently aiming to go to (most probably an engineering course in) NUS/NTU. Uni engineering courses typically have an average IGP of 3.6 in the 10th percentile and 3.95 in the 90th percentile. However, i did not join any CCAs at all (such as ambass/society also) and is not planning to in the span of my poly life. I was wondering if anybody was in the same situation as me and still managed to go to NUS/NTU in particular because i know that engineering courses might be competitive and a lot of people might have a high gpa, hence it might ultimately boil down to portfolio :')..... My classmates and lecturers also kept telling me that i might not be able to enter NUS/NTU due to this i just feel extremely disheartened..... But, i really do not regret not joining a CCA because i had more free time to do the things that i want and rest more too.

1. Can I take a second major in biz after my first year?
2. Does NTU differentiate double majors and second majors? Apparently in the former, both majors are equally heavy but in the latter, the secondary major is lighter in load?? So if I can actually take up a biz major later on tgt with ppga is it a double major or second major? 
3. Assuming I got to take biz with ppga, will I be able to get a job in either related industries? Or will biz just be seen as a value add to my PGPA major (since I still get a single degree) so I can most likely only pursue a career related to PGPA?

as i withdraw from jae and accepted my course in dae, the enrolment portal was opened again till end of march. i have accepted the course, submitted the compulsory documents, and done everything that was needed. when my laptop arrived, i tried to configure it, however im stuck at the very first step because they said my student id doesnt not exist in their database. so i emailed the admission office for help and i was told that the email would arrive on 30th March, and i should asked the IT department for help if i still have a problem. its been a few days and i have not received anything yet. so i sent two emails to both the admission office and the IT department regarding this issue. today i called the IT Department, and they told me the issue lies with the admission office. so they passed the message and i have decided to give the admission office a call on monday morning, and possibly head down to sch in the afternoon or the next day to speed up the process

for the past few weeks, a lot of rp students have received a sms telling them that they can apply for a concession card at transit link website. i again did not receive anything. when i tried entering my ic number into the online portal, transit link told me that my data was not found in their data base. i have also emailed rp admission office about this issue.

can i just check if anyone is in the same situation as me? or you have been in this situation before? is it possible that i might have been left out? i have a friend who was told that the admission office forgotten to send him an email for his dae interview, and he was supposed to receive the email by yesterday but nothing came.

[UNI] My SIT Kira Interview experience (Radiation Therapy),University :snoo_smile:,1585997059.0,"Hi! I have just completed my SIT Kira Interview. While the experience remains fresh in my brain, I have decided to post what I have went through in order to help people who are going for this soon.\*\* Before my interview, I read through a fellow person's post about the SIT Kira Interview experience. It was a very thorough post and helped me a lot so I **will not** be repeating what the person has mentioned.

* It was 18 questions for me. The first question was not a question because the system just needed you to place your ID (NRIC / Passport) next to your face and say your full name out loud.
* You **do not** need to be worried about the sound quality of the recording. If the sound quality is bad, the system actually knows. The system would ask you to redo the question immediately. (It was like that for me at least!)
* For point no.2, I finished the assessment at 12p.m. sharp today. At 2p.m., they emailed me to ask me to redo the first question. That was because they could not confirm my identity for some reason. So please do **check your email** even though you finished the test already. This is important especially for the people who are only going to do this right before the deadline.
* There were scenario based questions. Unlike what I expected, the scenario based questions were not based on events that would happen in the hospital. There were a total of **two scenarios** but **four questions.** Both questions were not based in a hospital setting. Both scenarios gave me a position in the community (e.g. Grassroots leader) and a random situation and wanted you to roleplay. You play two different characters in the two different scenarios.
* There were quite a feel **what would you do / how do you feel** questions. Apparently, they said in the question that they wanted to see how people deal with adverse situations and difficulties. For example, mine asked me how I would feel and what I would do if I failed an exam and my scholarship was going to be taken away. Additionally, I had ""financial difficulties"" and how I would react and how I felt about this.
* They actually do ask you what you would do if you do not succeed in getting into this course! (I was totally not prepared and probably screwed this up)
* I was not prepared but please think about **someone** who influenced you a lot in your life (link it to your course). OR An **event** that has influenced you a lot in your life.
* Lastly, I would like to encourage all of you to be careful when doing this test. I have realised that when writing the 30 minutes essay question and when you are preparing the answers to the questions, the green camera light for macbook is still on. I went to do some small research and found out that if the green camera light is still on, the camera is still on. I am actually **not sure** if they keep a recording of you preparing the answers to your questions, but I am just asking all of you to be as careful as possible! Don't do anything weird that you wouldn't actually do in a face to face interview ok! (If I am wrong about this please let me know because I actually sneezed in front of the camera accidentally hahaha)

I hope this might help someone along the way! All the best to you if you are going to do this interview soon!

Disclaimer: This is MY experience. Everyone's experience is going to be different because I don't think they are going to ask the same pre-recorded questions. However, I do hope you take something from this post. 

Tips:

1. Prepare your NRIC or Passport or 11B
2. Say your FULL NAME into the screen for the FIRST question while holding your identity proof
3. Look decent. If you are a makeup-wearer, put some light makeup on! The sun is actually right opposite me so in front of the webcam, it can reveal your imperfections. 
4. OPEN GOOGLE. YOU WILL NEED IT. TRUST ME. 
5. Fake confidence and make it believable. You will be nervous because you don't have a lot of time to research
6. Do your best! 

Interview:

Disclaimer - These are MY questions that I received. You might receive different ones and I will not be held liable if anything were to change or it feels like I short-changed you. Use these as a guide of the level of difficulty

1. What is creative accounting?
2. Why do you think it is important for accountants to upskill with the introduction of technology? (something like this-ish)
3. Do you think that RPA and AI will replace accounting jobs in the future?

Sorry I have like no gc left after A Levels but came across this question so I just give you general tips for this question:\n\ni) There are two parents, one at the back and one at front - and there are 7 remaining children. The order of the children matters, so you find the number of PERMUTATIONS of these 7, then multiply by two (because you can reverse the parent order for any of your permutations)\n\nii) You have 3 sisters, so you CHOOSE 1 of 3, and then consider the parentsisterparent group as one person for you to permute the new number of (2 sisters, parentsisterparent, 4 brothers) 7 people and finally also multiply by two (because again, can reverse parents order)\n\niii) Seats are indistinguishable means the seating in a circle formula (n-1)! or (n!)/n depending on which form you learn, they are the same -> basically, if they were in a line, you would do the n! but because the seats in indistinguishable, you divide by the n number of seats. \n\nThe 'no two brothers' makes you think of the slotting method, I found that drawing a circle with the number of seats helped me. So you have to 'fix' the position of the brothers, the 4 of them, and then you 'slot' the five remaining members in between them.

[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,:redditgold: MUST-READS: University :snoo_smile:,1585974513.0,"I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I‚Äôm not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (third choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don‚Äôt shame me, it‚Äôs fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there‚Äôs literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people‚Äôs portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler ‚Äì 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard ‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard‚Äìpaper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore‚Äôs/the world's best architectures and what makes them good.¬†Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‚Äòcan multiple hierarchies coexist?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?‚Äô and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question.¬†It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you‚Äôre trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‚Äòabstract‚Äô while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

[https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu](https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn‚Äôt want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‚Äòhm! Good enough‚Äô. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‚Äòis the first one from an anime?‚Äô and ‚Äòwas the third one a class assignment?‚Äô and ‚Äòwere the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?‚Äô (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‚Äòwhy do you want to study architecture?‚Äô and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn‚Äôt really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‚Äòso why is archi your third choice?‚Äô and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they‚Äôre applying for Uni.

[O levels] Am i too ambitious?,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585969892.0,"Hello, I'm sec 3 and I'm currently taking english, math, chinese, comb chem/phy, geog/ss, poa and fnn. I wouldn't say that I did well for all my subjects for WA1. I find that math, poa and fnn are the easiest for me to score a distinction but I'm not that good in my languages, I'm good in chemistry but I'm kind of struggling with physics which kind of frustrates me and honestly both my geog and ss teachers just can't teach (im sorry ;-;) I'm making my own notes for geog at the moment since my school doesn't give any notes for geog, and honestly I'm not sure what to study for ss other than just memorising the format. Im planning take amath (and maybe pure bio) as a
private candidate but I'm currently not doing well in amath, self studying amath apparently doesn't work well for me as I only know how to do the basic questions (sigh), I don't really want to turn to my math teacher for help either and my friends don't really have the time to help me as they are also busy. Pure Bio is not going so well either but I managed to do my school's paper and passed, should I start making my own simplified notes like geog?

Why do I want to take a math and pure bio?
Well it's because my aim is to go to a top tier jc and im planning to go to the science stream and I've seen that you require both pure science and a math. 

My aim is to get 6 points for o levels and I'm currently getting like 18..
Does anyone have a suggestion on what i should do? Should I just stick to my own subject combi or should I continue? Should I aim for something more realistic and just aim to go for a more easier to get in jc? I know being ambitious is good but I'm afraid that if I aim too high I might actually fall and be disappointed with the end result. The students in the better classes taking pure in my school aren't even aiming for something I'm aiming for.. 
I've told some of my friends about my aim, they don't seem to believe that I can do it either and my teachers don't seem to think I can even make it to a jc and told me to just go for a poly instead since its my level.. Am I being delusional?

I tried to study ahead at end of Sec 2 by reading textbook and I could also only do basic questions. I found that having a teacher explaining the basics to you really helps, so you should consider that, or look up some videos on the topic you‚Äôre working on on YouTube.\nAs for being too ambitious, I think it‚Äôs ok to aim high, and I‚Äôve heard that even the Sec 4 prelim results don‚Äôt determine your final result.

You can memorize content for GI from tb cause answers just come from there but try memorize other stuff from tb theres too much. I have to say this, do not topic spot, for olvl only select topics come out and it's really risky to topic spot cause you can get fucked. \n\nFor ss, really all you can do is understand and memorize the format and for srq same thing have a grasp of the key points and bs through you should be good.\n\nIt's really possible to have a good jump in grades, especially since you're in sec 3, just put in the effort and work hard. Since you already know you can get distinctions in some subjects, focus on the weaker ones rather than jumping into a  new subject that you're not sure you can well in.

[A levels] Feeling sad about J2 test grades,A Levels :snoo:,1585969288.0,"J2 grades test results

J2 test results

I‚Äôm currently a J2 and honestly though my school doesn‚Äôt have MCT (or those block tests most schools had during march), we did have lecture tests etc for around every 3 chapters for each subject. 

I‚Äôm still doing alright with most subjects (I take HCME), but my math results... 

I got 6/40 for my math test on complex numbers, integration and DE. 

I know i shouldn‚Äôt feel disheartened and should continue to keep trying, but I just can‚Äôt help but feel that I can‚Äôt improve in time for A levels. 

I‚Äôm also worried of telling my parents about my grades for math (especially for this test) because I‚Äôm afraid of them being upset. I‚Äôll probably have to tell them soon since Parent teacher meet is on 8th may for my school, but i just can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to do it.

[A levels] school closures,A Levels :snoo:,1585965299.0,I am taking Alevels this year. I can‚Äôt really study at home. How am I gonna survive 1 month? The HBL wasn‚Äôt even that good for me and I prefer lessons in school. I am quite weak in all my subjects. Anyone can give me some advice on how to study during this period? Really worried because I didnt even do well for bt and now I don‚Äôt even have mye to see how much I have learnt.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ful90l/a_levels_school_closures/,139,"['You can face time friends/ classmates while studying? They‚Äôre purely there to motivate you cuz if you physically see others studying you feel more motivated to study too. If you‚Äôre too shy to ask just search up ‚Äústudy with me‚Äù videos on YouTube, there are livestreams and 6-8 hour videos of ppl legitimately studying', 'hello! j2 here with science combi (physics). personally i have always preferred self-studying to lessons so heres my take on how to be productive with studying alone! some of these may be obvious but yea here goes:\n\n1. choose a good place in your house where you can sit and focus. have enough space for writing, a glass of water, and youre set. no need to be super neat (i am never)!\n\n2. listening or not listening to music is your choice, personally i find that on some days for some tasks the ""demand"" for music is different. when you are trying to learn new content or use your brain heavily (e.g. for math), i think no music is more likely to work better. but this is your personal preference! take some time to figure out what you need\n\n3. if there are videos, it is not necessary to watch them. coming from someone who has not watched a single tutorial/lecture video from my school (for any of my subjects), i find that it can be very slow to watch videos and learn, also easier to get distracted. instead, try to read the notes independently and attempt the examples. if you really need solutions to guide you through and there is no pdf solution (reading is definitely faster than watching), you dont have to watch the whole video! just speed to where the whole solution is, copy it down, and figure out independently why it works this way. this helps long term understanding than just watching and copying ! (ithink)\n\n4. dont wait to ask! at any instance where you are stuck on one question and have been thinking about it for a while, that is the best time to ask your friends or teachers for help! when the problem is fresh in your mind and you have thought about it, that is the best time to look at the solution and it is a lot easier to internalise what others teach you then. if you decide to put the question off, not only will you have to relook at it when you next ask, but you would not be fresh with all your thoughts when you receive an answer, which is less effective for learning.\n\n5. discipline! you dont have to study everyday for ten hours if you dont feel like it, in fact dont study when you dont feel like it. (without school i sleep for twelve hours a day and study for any amount of time between zero to ten hours inclusive, and hey im doing fine in school, so dont stress about not studying ""enough hours""-- theres no such thing!) i mean discipline as in you maintain focus and productivity when you decide to study, and dont let yourself off until youre done with your tasks. no matter how fed up you are about it, keep yourself there until you finish it, and you can relax better afterwards.\n\n6. working smart is better than working hard, take this time to try things out and work out a way which works best for you. for the two months before a levels, youll probably have to spend lots of time studying on your own, so its good to start trying now!\n\njiayous !! you can do this (:', 'For me, I just take out my water bottle and leave it on my table.

2. applied for NUS ChE and NTU CBE as first choice but have only received offer from NTU
3. applied for NUS and NTU scholarships but haven‚Äôt heard anything yet
4. also applied for SgIS scholarship, will apply for DSTA and University Engineering Scholarship soon

questions:
1. what are my chances of getting into NUS ChE? read that someone on hwz got rejected with a 3.93 a few years back so I‚Äôm quite worried
2. what are my chances of getting school scholarships for both NUS and NTU? are my chances very low or none if my tutor didn‚Äôt submit an appraisal
3. what are my chances of getting the University Engineering Scholarship? can‚Äôt find much info about it on reddit/hwz

I‚Äôm not sure about entry but while I was at the NTU gallery for art teaching, I talked to a mother tongue teacher who switched to teaching art so maybe that possible? \n\nHope this gives you some idea to plan financially', 'The fully subsidised cost is when you sign up a bond of 5 years with MOE right? It seems like applying through NAFA and applying through MOE is diff given that their application dates are diff.. I do not want to be bonded but is that the only option to avoid paying full fees of a whopping 19k?', 'The thing is applying with MOE actually lets you have the qualification to teach in schools unless that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want because the whole point of art teaching is to teach at schools. But not everybody gets it you know, only the best art students can get the fully subsidised option. An ‚ÄòA‚Äô for O levels might not even let you pass the MOE interview. They used to combine the interview with MOE but I think a change of system happened. I really think the bond is a super good option to secure a good job that lets you teach at secondary/JC after a couple years of experience. NAFA sadly has no follow up degree course for art teaching also.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to teach art classes outside, you can do that but it is not advisable in my opinion. Other diploma like fine arts and arts management can do the same. The students on their internships did teach children. There‚Äôs a thing with pay differences in the industry and the students were getting paid peanuts during their internship. If you‚Äôre going to cover cost with awards, you‚Äôd have to fight these people for the awards since they‚Äôre talented.\n\nAnd lastly I‚Äôm not going to suggest working part time. You can‚Äôt do that at NAFA. Absolutely not. Best option, study study study and sign up for the annual awards', 'Hey! Thank you so much for the well thought out reply it is very insightful. May I know how should I start building up my portfolio then? What kind of artworks should I showcase during the interview in order to get in? Also, will they decide to fully subsidised school fees right after the interview process or they still need to see my performance throughout my 4 years of studies?', 'Also, the NAFA application is until May 2020 but the MOE scheme side says that their JAE has already ended. Does this mean that I have to wait until next year to apply?', 'Well my friend that did the interview was good at oil painting and charcoal drawings but got rejected. Had a feeling it was the discussion that wasn‚Äôt good. Instead, she just got the scholarship and did fine arts. She did receive the non-subsidised offer but no point since she wanted to teach at schools. The art medium for the portfolio has to be somewhat basic. Oil paining, charcoal, pencil sketches, acrylic painting, clay sculpting (much less) etc stuff suitable to be taught at school. Definitely start your portfolio immediately but pace yourself so the work looks good.\n\nThey‚Äôll immediately let you know after the interview results. There‚Äôll be terms and conditions to follow but not sure. As long as you remain a good student should be enough.', 'I‚Äôm not sure about that. You should ask the NAFA admission office about this', 'Ok! Last question!

[This blog](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/education/moe-teacher-salary-private-tutors/) says from 1.7-2.3k. Once you get on teaching for years, pay could go up to 3-6k.

[A Levels] should i drop out because of covid-19?,A Levels :snoo:,1585921668.0,"
im not ready. it‚Äôs fucking terrifying. 


i took BCME in my first year, then switched to HELM. i don‚Äôt regret the change despite not taking most of the arts subjects, in fact im doing much better. in j1 i was doing fine with 60 rank points (average A B Cs) and i thought i was finally on the right track with matching aptitude in the arts, maybe 2020 would be my year? 

well .. apparently not. IF i had graduated w my batch i could‚Äôve avoided this whole situation. due to covid: all subject teachers have closed consultations, even online chats like zoom are limited to 15 minutes bc my lit teacher has a 7 year old in the house. 

i didnt expect this at all.

my results have also all dropped and im hovering around S es despite so much hard work. especially h2 history and h2 lit.

ASR hasnt given ONE sample essay for history, and for h2 lit i really dont know where to start. 

these are my books: p1 (TGG, playing for time) and p3 (woman in mind, virginia woolf, regeneration)

i shouldve known ASR wasn‚Äôt a arts niche school, hell, we have one lit teacher for the whole h2 cohort. (p1) i hear of other schools getting so much resources but asr hardly gives any. we dont have homework every week aside from the occasional paragraph.

its been almost 2 years, we‚Äôre supposed to be gearing up for As but its just not happening. maybe im the only one feeling this? 

im studied hard, went in ASR with 9 points but my school really has to step it up on their lit department. there is no structure and every lesson feels like im being cheated of my grades. i keep trying to write essays for my teachers but they just keep putting me off. dont know what to do honestly üò≠üò≠üò≠ ive already wasted one year and i just want to get my grades. its really tough being a repeat bc theres so much pressure and stress that you have to do well. im pretty healthy mentally but the waves of anxiety are really making me sick

[A Levels] HBL is probably gonna make me rot at home,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585912263.0,"JC has been pretty hard on me. 

When I first stepped into JC, I was pretty stressed about a bunch of stuff, such as my choice for subject combi and cca. After that was settled, I began stressing out on my academics. I took combined science in o levels and have taken up 2 h2 science subjects in JC. I became stressed from the big jump in difficulty and depth of the topics, and there were stuff that was only taught in pure science that the lecturers assumed we knew about and I had to figure that out myself. 

But one of the reasons I am still persevering on is my friends in my og and class. They've been making JC life way more bearable and enjoyable and I always knew that they were also in the same boat. 

However, because of HBL today, I hadn't had any interactions with them, besides them asking about HBL matters. Moreover, I am a peripheral member of a clique I am in now, and I only talk to them at school and they'd normally do stuff like facetime without me (they're actually really nice ppl and I have nothing against them, I just haven't reached that level of closeness in my friendships with them compared to them with one another, don't misinterpret it as exclusion). 

And often times when I'm alone, a lot of negative and insecure feelings would cloud my thoughts and I'd often mumble deprecating things about myself. And given that HBL will start daily from next week, I have become worried about my mental wellness as I'd probably have very little interaction with my friends. There have been articles about how cases of mental health issues in people have spiked on the first day of lockdown in the UK, and I'm worried that my mental health will further deteriorate after the full HBL has been implemented. 

I don't need anyone's pity or sympathy or anything like that, because I just wanted to vent out my feelings. As much as I want to be closer to my friends at school and want to do all those close friends would do, I probably won't be able to because tbh I haven't really done that with my friends in pri or sec sch, what makes me think I can have such close friendships in JC life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu6j1i/a_levels_hbl_is_probably_gonna_make_me_rot_at_home/,41,"['take the first step and ask to skype or sth!! it may seem really daunting but its really worth it!! maybe theres other peripheral members in your clique too haha then yall can be close together.. if not just ask the entire group? you said that they are nice so they probs wont reject u and facetime between themselves (maybe they just think you wouldnt care to facetime them cus yall not close)', ""You can do it bro!!! Take a deep breathe and continue on. No one knows what will happen in the future so don't worry about not having close friends and focus on living in the present and pursue whatever goals you have.

[A Levels] Senior's Advice,A Levels :snoo:,1585909944.0,"Hi! In light of this whole HBL thing, I want to offer some advice taken from what I went through. I'm a senior who took A levels last year. One thing that's vv important to note is please don't get carried away and slack. In my J2 year, I took things free and easy even up till June holidays, then I realised I had much less time than I thought I did. (As in, I didn't study during June at all.) 

Yes, for those of you who are struggling in school for personal reasons or anything and are really happy about being able to ""take a break"", go ahead. Take the time to recharge. In fact, I do advise that everyone should relax. This is to prevent burning out. 

But do also continue to keep up with the syllabus and start your revision! I heard that mid year might be affected... as in cancelled. If this really comes to pass, it would mean that you'll only know how much you know at prelims. You don't want to go into prelims getting straight U's. By then, it'll be pretty hard to do well due to the time constraint.

Many people do not have the self-discipline to keep up with their studies even as they are attending school (not taking initiative to clarify doubts with the teacher etc, not doing homework, not listening in lecture). Fewer will have the self-discipline to bother with their studies in this season of quarantine. But remember that consequences await for whatever choices you make. I know quite a lot of people from different JCs who didn't do well (some are retaking right now). I also have friends who U-turned (drop to J1 during A levels) because they felt they weren't prepared enough. Not doing well for A levels is a very real reality for everyone. The reason will differ for everyone but do you really want your reason to be because you didn't study hard enough?

Eventually, many people do come around to trying hard when the A levels near. Sometimes, it's when they see their mid years. Other times, it's when they see their prelims. In this context, there may not even be a mid year exam and to wait for prelims would already be too late. My friend U-turned 30 days before A levels. He gave up before he even took the exam. A levels is a mental war and you don't want to have a self defeatist attitude and worse, it's justified because you KNOW you didn't study hard enough. My point is, there comes a time when there's a point of no return. Now is probably not that time yet. But that time always comes without us knowing.

By all means, take your breaks. Enjoy your hobbies. Spend time with your family. But don't use this quarantine season to run away from what you fear because problems aren't solved that way.

Support is also pretty important! You should probably continue to keep in touch with your classmates and friends because even if you aren't close to them/don't like them, you guys are still going through the same thing and it helps to not feel alone. If you don't mind, you can also talk to your teachers as well! You should probably talk to them about how you can complement your own learning.

PS: I probably sound pretty harsh because I'm the idiot who slacked and I know more people who are disappointed with their grades than people who are happy with them. And I know many people who are lazing around despite saying ""oh, I want to be doctor"" and it just doesn't sit well with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu622b/a_levels_seniors_advice/,31,"['i second op‚Äôs post i slacked till june too and paid the price when my myes were so shit had to work rlly hard to get back on track sometimes i will wonder how things will be different if i hadn‚Äôt slacked', 'Hehe thank you for the wise words!!

Never be complacent, always be prepared

There were signed petition for school closures.

Every student and teacher had a chance to go through Home based learning. Loaned out many laptops and WiFi to students who don't have. The exercise this week went smoothly. 

It is now time to move to full home based learning. 
From Wednesday, 8 April onwards, Home based learning until 4th May. 

Required to stay at home. 

School remains open to those who need support.

Exams: Do away for all mid year school exams. National exams are still essential and will continue.

O level MT exams will proceed. Year end exams no need to worry for now.

Marking will be adjusted to be more lenient and can apply special consideration. 

Student Care: Remain open for parents who need support with all the health measures in place, thermometer and etc.

Uni: All exam and homework assignment at home

Poly and ITE: New batch of students, first years, come to campus, register and get equipped for online learning. Students will be coming in small separate batches for the next few weeks. 

Advice: Try to learn outside of syllabus, find the curiousity in you and learn what you are interested in during this time (lol)

[O Levels] Scoring straight A1s in Secondary English and N/O Level English -- Paper 4 Oral edition,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585900214.0,"In this discourse today, I will be sharing some tips and tricks to study and prepare for N/O Level English Oral. Often, students are at a loss and do not know where to place their focus on for English Oral. As such, they often go into the exam with barely any preparation. In 2020, the syllabus for English Oral has changed -- information is now presented in a video format instead of a singular picture. Furthermore, many students are worried because the oral exam has been postponed as well. However, with the correct preparation technique, I believe that English Oral is an accessible component for students to score well in.

1. **When your preparation time starts**

10 minutes is not a lot of time, if I do say so myself. However, it is sufficient time to prepare for both sections if the time is managed well. Usually, I will allocate 3 minutes for the passage preparation. Read through once, and sift out the areas that emphasis has to be placed on. Don't dwell on the passage for too long as you will require more time to brainstorm for the spoken interaction. Watch the video very closely. 2-3 times would be advisable, and take note of every single detail. After watching the video, immediately start to brainstorm on your ideas and key points. More explanation on preparation for this part can be found below under spoken interaction so i will not delve into it here. 

**2. Reading Aloud**

""You can't prepare for reading aloud. Just go in and read the passage."" This is a common misconception that many students have. Due to our overuse of Singlish and sometimes, lousy English teachers \*cough\*, we get overly accustomed to pronouncing a certain word in a certain way. Fluency of reading is not difficult, hence examiners often pay extra close attention to the candidate's word pronunciation. Let's start with the most commonly used word, 'the'. If the immediate word following 'the' is a vowel (meaning AEIOU), 'the' is pronounced as 'thee'. However, if the following word is not a vowel, 'the' is pronounced as 'th-uh'. This is just one of the multitude of pronunciation errors that students make in the examination. To prepare for reading aloud, make a habit of searching up a BRITISH DICTIONARY (not American!!!) for the pronunciation of any word that you may be unsure of. I can't be listing down every single word here, but try to make a compilation of commonly mispronounced words and practice reading them out loud individually, then in a sentence. When reading, aim to make the words flow. Don't just look at the word that comes right after, look at the rest of the sentence that follows a particular word. This can make a difference especially when you have to decide which word to place more emphasis and stress on. You may think that it is a little too late to say this, but try to incorporate accurate word pronunciations into your everyday conversations. Correct your family members and friends when they pronounce a word inaccurately. It is the little habits that we can correct to make ourselves more proficient at the language. Another important thing to take note of is articulation. Pronounce all 'th' 't' 'k' well, reading each word slowly. DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THE PASSAGE. Be careful when pronouncing words like 'tests'. Articulation will come easier when the passage is read slowly, but be careful not to undermine the areas of the passage that require emphasis.

3. **Spoken Interaction**

Students' biggest fear. The key to this section of the examination, as many students don't realise, is to let yourself go and just speak. Even if you are shaking with nerves on the inside (i was too, don't worry), just calm your outer appearance and pretend like everything is fine and dandy. There are ways to prepare yourself so you can be much less nervous on the day of the examination. If we were to take a look at the ALL the topics Cambridge could EVER come out with for an oral examination, how many are there? If we narrow it down into broad categories to ease our preparation, I can only come out with a handful. Technology, Arts and Culture, Family, Money, Transportation, Health, Ageing Population, Education. These are practically the only few broad categories that they could ever test you on. So based on these broad topics, prepare a handbook of recent news articles and stories. Take a look at the 2019 O Level English Oral. They combined technology and education, asking about the use of computers for education. From here, you can start doing some research and reading up on how technology has influenced education in recent years. You could even bring up how tuition centres and schools have been using online platforms to teach during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Or talk about the regular Home Based Learning days that schools usually implement occasionally. With sufficient examples prepared, you can then move on to weighing the pros and cons of using these means. e.g. ""Yes, these online learning platforms are beneficial as they facilitate independent learning, training students to be more self disciplined to complete their tasks without having to go to school. However, it can be detrimental as the lack of supervision could result in students slacking off, procrastinating more, and may not be effective in educating them."" You could also talk about how technology is expensive, and students from lower-income households may not have the means to purchase a personal laptop for their studies, especially when there are multiple children in the same household. By drawing out a mental mind map of this thought-flow process, you will be able to, with practice, come out with points very quickly. With more practice, you will get the gist of the kind of possible questions you may be asked in the examination based on these broad categories itself.

Another method I found extremely effective is to hold conversations with people. I often converse with my mother, asking questions like ""What do you think of the government imposing a sugar tax on food and beverages with high sugar content?"" Conversing with others will help you widen the viewpoint and expand your horizons, giving you more alternate perspectives to a certain topic. This is especially helpful for those who have difficulty coming up with points to talk about. Garner as many different opinions as possible, so you will have an array of ideas at your fingertips.

Lastly, I must emphasise this. Good use of vocabulary is extremely paramount in spoken interaction. It adds colour to the point you are trying to bring across. I have mentioned how to improve your command of vocabulary in my previous post for paper 1, so I won't delve into it further here. However, an extra tip for English oral would be to come out with key helping phrases for yourself. For instance, one phrase to describe transportation would be that it 'forms the backbone of every nation'.

 I want to study education/drama. (Yes I know NIE is an option but I do not want to be a school teacher. I want to do something different.) I spent the last 3 years working in a student care and loved it. Now I want to take private a levels this year. Brand new.
I came from Poly but my GPA was 2.85. 24F this year. I am a linguistic person and like humanities. But due to some family problems my grades suffered from O level till poly. For O levels I scored A2 for English and B4 for Combined humanities. Yes, I know it's not stellar. But I'm older now and I am more focused. Another plus point is i can pick the subjects I'm strong in. Problem is....I know it's competitive. You have Raffles and other top JC students all competing. And I'm just a private candidate. And I feel quite old already. So question is, should I take this route?  Because i know I'll study hard. I'm just afraid I'll be discriminated against because I'm not from some top JC or even in a school. If not my other option is LaSalle Musical theatre because I hope to be a performer or a drama teacher next time. The other more ""practical"" (but not that passionate) option would be SIM BA communication/international relations.
 
Also I heard of some taking 4 H2s to be more desirable. I'm intending to take H2: Geog, Lit and Econs. (Maybe Bio). A question I have is do I have to take H1 Math, Chinese and GP? If l am aiming for overseas, i heard it's not needed. 
If you have feedback please let me know your thoughts. As you know I'm not from JC and can't seek help from teachers about this. Would appreciate any opinion on the choice I'm making. Edit: I'm thankful for the feedback I'm receiving. I do not mean to sound ignorant or naive. I hope you understand I'm just really trying to find my way too. It hasn't been easy.

Apart from what everyone else said, JC subjects are challenging to study and get straight A‚Äôs for even for students from top tier JCs. Even in those schools not everyone takes 4H2s. People who score 6 points raw in Olevels or IP students from top tier secondary schools still study for whole days with teachers‚Äô guidance and school resources and might not even get straight A‚Äôs. JC subjects are nothing like Olevel subjects (Olevel subjects barely scratch the surface, even more so if you got a B4 in combined humanities and want to take h2 geog in JC) and they‚Äôll be even tougher if you have no guidance at all and have not been in the habit of studying in a long time. It‚Äôs not the type of content you can just memorize like Olevels, you have to really understand everything very well especially if you want straight A‚Äôs. Idk if you know this but amongst JC students, Geog and Bio together is considered a suicide combination because they are both the most content heavy by far and by that I mean stacks and stacks of lecture notes that you have to memorize, internalize and apply. And practical is 20% of science subjects so keep in mind you have to know how to do them well for Bio.

[O Levels] Scoring Straight A1s for Secondary English and O Level English-- Paper 1 edition,:redditgold: MUST-READS: O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585837295.0,"In this discourse today, i would like to share my tips and tricks on scoring well in O Level english paper 1. I have seen many posts about students struggling with english, and ultimately not scoring as well as expected in N/O levels just because of a low english grade.

As everyone knows, english is a compulsory subject taken into account in all grading systems -- EMB3, L1R4, L1R5, EL1B2R2 etc. Because of this, i just wanted to say that Cambridge will make the english paper accessible for everyone. Accessible, by no means easy, nor difficult. The paper is structured  in a way which helps to maximise students' grades for the subject itself.

**Paper 1**

1. **General Preparation Tips**

Firstly, I would like to emphasise a point that many often overlook. How many points have you lost due to carelessness, especially because of poor grammar? PLEASE CHECK YOUR WORK. The english paper 1 is structured in a way that gives you sufficient time to reread your essays to correct these mistakes. Minimising these mistakes can actually help you see an increase in grades.

Secondly, reading plays a huge, if not the biggest, part of paper 1 prep. The common question would be: "" what kind of content should i be consuming?"" Let's be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don't think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question. Something that i find extremely helpful are the Beyond Horizons magazines. i'm not sure if these are ordered in all schools, but if you have the means to, the subscription is worth spending the money on. The magazine offers an array of content -- from day-to-day experiences and stories, to tips and tricks for writing, and even comprehension and editing exercises. They offer fantastic reads in each volume and can definitely help in writing. Reader's Digest is also excellent in the content they provide. The topics discussed definitely struck a chord with me, and in turn offered me inspiration to manifest my thoughts and opinions in my writing.  Apart from these two series, keeping up with current affairs is also paramount to aid with coming up with content and examples in writing.

Thirdly, vocabulary. Vomiting all the vocabulary that you know is useful ONLY IF you use the words aptly. Certain words have nuances that we often overlook, causing the word to be inappropriately used in a certain situation, resulting in deduction of points due to 'WW' -- 'Wrong Word'. I personally don't have the superb power to come out with an unbelievably touching story or discussion that will move the marker to tears. Hence i depended on vocabulary a lot. I was so desperate to use as much vocab as possible in my writing, that i compiled a huge list of vocab words and their meanings, and crammed my brain with as many as possible for me to use in my writing. Learning vocabulary depends on how much effort you are willing to put in OVER TIME . It cannot be done a week before the english exam. So, if you are preparing for O/N Levels 2020, PLEASE START NOW. 

2.  **Editing**

The easiest section of the entire english paper. It's basically a free 10 mark section. The tricks are simple -- identify the keywords that will help you determine the faulty parts of the sentence. Setters always like to hide the mistakes at the end of a line, or the beginning of a line. Read well. The mistakes are not as difficult to spot once you have a grip of what's going on in the passage. That being said, do NOT rush into circling the mistakes immediately. Go through the passage once first, identify if it is in past, present or future tense, then proceed with attempting the questions. Nothing much to be said about editing, just be very careful as to not make careless mistakes. 

3. **Situational Writing**

Be very clear about the formats. Commit the differences in formal vs informal, email vs letter, news article, speech, to memory. You do not want to lose any marks because of wrong format. Next, annotate the question given. Take note of your Purpose, Audience and Context. These are all defining factors on how you should sculpt your writing. Make sure that you are clear of the question requirements. Break the requirements down, assigning them a paragraph each. After writing, make sure that your piece has met all the requirements (task fulfilment). One thing that many struggle with is keeping the tone. While writing, you have to consciously remind yourself to take note of the tone of your writing. If you are writing to a senior teacher, for instance, be very aware of the level of his/her seniority and sculpt your piece carefully. One more thing -- DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER. Only give yourself 45 minutes, capped at 50. You need much more time to plan your essay, so do not dwell on situational writing for too long. 

4. **Essay writing**

My favourite part of english. To begin, if you have ever been told to just focus on the style you're good at, please throw that advice out of the window right away. Cambridge is unpredictable. You could be fantastic at writing expository essays, but all it takes is one difficult and abstract topic to come out and you could be screwed over right away. Hence it is important to be versatile in your writing skills. While it is important to hone your skills in expository essays as they are more likely to be applicable in the future, it is equally important to be well-versed in the skills of writing descriptive, personal reflection and recount essays. The first step to attempting an essay of sorts is to come out with a detailed plan. Underline keywords, identify the important bits of the question, find out how you should elaborate on each content paragraph. Planning is an important step that many often overlook as they find it unnecessary. Having a plan will give you a clear idea of which direction to steer your story in. 

I will further break essay writing down into 2 parts, namely expository writing and narrative essays. 

For expository writing, start off by making the marker want to read your story. Make it intriguing. Draw the reader in and capture their attention from the very start. Personally, i am more well versed in descriptive writing, but i enjoy writing expository essays more. Hence, I often start off my expository essays with an anecdote. An anecdote is a short story, or an episode. By drawing in a personal example of your own, or creating a short but intriguing story, you will be able to effectively interest the reader right from the start. You can also start off with a hook, a quote, or a popular saying -- there are a multitude of story starters you could use. In your planning step for expository essays, you must prepare your points for your content paragraphs. This way, you can expound on each point once you reach that paragraph, facilitating a smoother thought process and flow in your writing. In a discursive essay, you should ideally have about 3-4 content paragraphs, while in an argumentative piece, you can have 2-3 points which are 'for' the statement, and one content paragraph for a rebuttal. I will not delve into how to write each paragraph. However, what i would like to touch on is the usage of examples in expository essays. Whatever you do, DO NOT USE THEORETICAL EXAMPLES. An example of a theoretical example is ""If a man uphold his rights and beliefs..."" Do not do this. Always have fresh and upcoming examples at the tips of your fingers. This is where the importance of reading comes in handy. You do not need to memorise statistics, but you need to provide a clear explanation which showcases your understanding of the example you have raised. At the very end of your essay, remember to balance out your points and give a conclusion that does not specifically point to one view, but instead sums up the points in the essay and give an equal weightage to each of the points raised in the content paragraphs. 

Most of the time, students avoid narrative essays. Personally, I would also choose to write an expository essay over a narrative essay. However, narrative essays reduce the likelihood of writing off-topic, which can cost you many marks. There is much less to unpack in a narrative essay question, as they usually ask you to ""write about a time..."", which involves some personal experiences to be brought in. It is easier to hit the content marks for narrative essays, so long as you meet the question requirements. However, in order to write a good narrative essay, lots of description has to be brought in. Think 5W1H. Producing a good narrative essay piece that 1) isn't too boring and 2) doesn't sound like a primary schooler's essay can be challenging. This is also where a good command of vocabulary comes in handy. To be able to visualise the scenario you are writing about is also paramount in ensuring that the reader gets the clearest idea that you are trying to bring across. When writing an essay on personal recount or personal reflection, remembering to bring across your feelings will help express the story better, making it less dry and unappetising. Keywords in narrative essay questions are also extremely important. Students must be aware if the question is asking for one instance, or for multiple episodes. Many students often miss this out, resulting in undesired content marks. Remember to conclude the story well and do not leave it hanging.

I have to say that it\'s very nicely written and am sure it will prove to be of good help to many in the near future. With that said, I\'d like to expand more on narrative essays since that was my focus during O\'s.\n\nDisclaimer: I\'ve noticed that Singaporean students tend to favour the expository/argumentative essays over narrative essays, so perhaps this is me pandering to a niche audience? I do, however, think that writing a good narrative essay can be picked up. The ability to manipulate and utilise the liberties of language will serve one well even into the future, especially during GP if the student so chooses to follow the JC route.\n\n# The Narrative Essay:\n\nBefore beginning to write a response to narrative essay types (henceforth referred to as \'NE\'), one must first *read the question*. It is a no-brainer, but many tend to overlook certain words or question requirements (e.g. A funny thing your *friend* did, A time you were *disappointed after being heavily expectant* for an event, A *person* you *admire*...).\n\nMany NE questions are conditional and the student must fulfil the first condition before proceeding to answer the question.\n\n**Content-wise:**\n\n*Smokability:* 7/10. Most NEs will give a vague description of an event or person and let you fill in the rest. I find it helpful to envision the skeleton of the event/person in my mind, then build on to that, starting with the question\'s requirements.\n\nExample: A person I admire.\n\nHere the question asks for a person (i.e. cannot be an object or group of people) that I admire (i.e. look up to, respect, aim to be like etc.). I would first think of people I admire, and see if there are any that I can just write about. If not, I would then think about good traits and smush them into one fake person. I would start with ""core"" traits -- characteristics I find essential to being ""admirable"". These core traits could then develop into further characteristics of an admirable character.\n\nDo be aware that ""admirable"" does not simply equate to ""good"", and over the course of the NE, you will have to show that these traits, in certain situations, made the person admirable.\n\n*Something to note: As people are invariably flawed, make sure that your smoked character (if you smoked it) has their own set of flaws, although you do not need to expressly state them. However, a character overcoming their flaws or outgrowing them (character growth!) could also be seen as admirable, so make of that what you will.*\n\nInevitably, you will be describing the person\'s appearance, and so it would be beneficial to have some vocabulary to describe them. You do not, however, need a laundry list of words to do so.\n\nSome areas to describe: The hair and state of it (insight into the way the person grooms him/herself), the way the person carries him/herself, the clothes he/she dresses in, and interesting things about them that might stand out.\n\nExample: *She was a willowy figure, slight of frame, though long in limb. Her eyes were the same muddy brown as her hair, which fell in smooth curtains down her head and flowed around her shoulders. She was not much to look at -- her face was plain; her clothes were simple and drab, and she seemed to curl into herself when she stood, shoulders bent inwards under the weight of the world. And yet, the ferocity of her gaze! What a marvel to behold; all at once, the waif of a girl was transfigured into a queen, all by the intensity of her stare. It was at odds with the smallness; the slightness of her demeanour and body, but it was all part of what made her,* her\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vocabulary/Description-wise:**\n\nI suppose the advice would be to ""show"" and not ""tell"", but I\'m not too fond of that myself. I believe that sometimes brevity is of the essence, and a ""tell"" can have more impact than a ""show"" in some cases. Short, snappy, and succinct, it will draw the reader\'s attention quickly, instead of drawing it *out*. Many scenes can benefit from a good ""tell"", and if you are running low on word count, find a way to make some descriptions less ""showy"".\n\nMany students mistakenly believe that long, extensive descriptions will net them marks in the NE. This is true to an extent, but without good content, and appropriate use of the big vocabulary, there is no benefit to be had. For example, throwing in 10 big words in a single paragraph has no gain if they are not used properly.\n\nFor the sake of being pedantic: Do not ""photosynthesise"" big words incorrectly.\n\ntl;dr: you do NOT need to over-describe. It is a *narrative* essay, not a *descriptive* one. The primary purpose is to *narrate*, i.e. ***tell a story***.\n\nI suppose 5W1H would help you, the student, to develop your writing to some degree, but this is more for planning than actually writing. You do not need to actively 5W1H your plan either -- as you think and plan, you will invariably end up doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Structure-wise:**\n\nA NE has a beginning, and end, and a body. There is no real ""structure"" in a NE, though many write it as though there is one.\n\nMy advice is to begin not by directly quoting the question ""...Here is a person I really admire..."" but to answer it *through* the essay. Easier said than done, I know. Here\'s an example I might do.\n\n1. Describe the person\n2. Something he/she did that I found admirable\n3. How my impression of them was affected/changed and I began to find them admirable (or any other variant)\n\nThere is no real limit or minimum number of paragraphs a student should have. As long as the story is told, and the examiner is not reading a wall of text, then you are generally good to go.\n\nParagraphing is IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Break up your writing!! You don\'t need to fit an entire event into one paragraph. It\'s ok to break them up. Save them eyes pls.', '>Let\'s be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don\'t think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question.\n\nIf I may contend with this:\n\nWhile ""storybooks"" and works of fiction may not necessarily present one with ""real-life"" current affairs content (in the context of an expository essay), I don\'t believe that one should dismiss them so easily. \n\nMany (older) works of fiction have writing styles and a certain use of the English language that may read ""smoother"" or be more ""pleasant"". They also utilise vocabulary rather naturally -- it does not feel forced, and the ability to do so can be learnt. It is by reading widely that we accumulate various writing styles and methods, so while fiction may not have immediate benefits in the realms of general knowledge, picking up on the style/language used would invariably contribute to a better language mark.\n\nThe paper is, after all, 50% language and 50% content. \n\nAs another note, reading widely (and hence including fiction) would provide content for questions about reading, books, philosophy... etc. They may not be ""current affairs"" material, but consider a question that involves discussing culture, traditions, and history. An older piece of fiction could be used as evidence to detail historical practises (with the explanation that works of fiction are often representative of the society at that time). Books on war, like Morpurgo\'s *Warhorse, Friend or Foe, Shadow,* and *The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips* may offer insight into the consequences of war -- on soldiers, on civilians, on society as a whole. And et cetera. You know how the argument goes.\n\nGranted, not everybody has the time to invest into fiction, so I understand when you say you did not read fiction in upper sec. I recall reading books I\'d already read before instead of branching out into new ones. Perhaps they are not the same situation, but I do see where you\'re coming from.\n\nStill, though, I think it\'s kinda unfair to say that they are ""out of the question"". I think there are benefits to be had, either directly or indirectly. \n\nBut again, I see your point. Just my two cents.', 'what assessments should i do?', 'Wished someone had told me this few years ago..\nThanks for the tips, some of them are applicable to General Paper too!', 'oral one coming soon! its always essential to be able to write essays in all styles because you can never predict what is coming out. sticking to one is risky. narrative essays are all about being aware of what the character sees, feels and hears (recall 5W1H).

[Uni][Poly]Messed up my life...need some advice,University :snoo_smile:,1585834740.0,"Sorry for the long text below.

Hi everyone, need some advice on how I should proceed with my current stage in life. 

I graduated poly in 2017 with a poly diploma with a cGPA of 3. Went on to serve NS (medical unit) for 2 years and ORD'd last year. 

I didn't really use my time in NS well to think about what I should do after I ORD and just wasted those 2 years away. Tried applying for SIT Comp Sci near my ORD date because of the demand for IT jobs and I thought that I would be interested in IT. But of course, with no prior educational or work experience in IT, I was rejected. Told myself that I would wait for the next SIT intake next year to try again and took up some part-time jobs in between.

Tried for this year's SIT Comp Sci and also applied for SIM Comp Sci. SIT didn't get back to me so I enrolled into SIM. After starting at SIM, I realise that I might not really be interested in IT and just sort of convinced myself because of the demand...right now I just feel like dropping out.

Currently, I'm thinking of doing something in healthcare or allied health (due to what I went through in NS) such as nursing but that would mean going back to poly for a diploma for another 3 years and I'm not sure if it's the right decision. Another option would be to find a full time job but I feel like no one will hire me because I don't have a lot of relevant work experience for the diploma. Really need some advice on what I should do.

I can't really eat and sleep properly nowadays because of this issue...I just wished I had not made so many poor decisions in life and messed it all up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftmhiv/unipolymessed_up_my_lifeneed_some_advice/,8,"['Looks like you really haven‚Äôt found your interest.

So unless you're loaded, going back to poly is probably not a good option.\n\nAn option you can consider is Parkway Health nursing!

[Poly] cgpa 3.1 what to do after getting rejected by unis?,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585813310.0,"Hey there! Hope you are all doing well in this whole ongoing situation but am here to seek advice as to what I should be doing after my diploma. I‚Äôve applied for local unis however my gpa is only 3.1. portfolio is really outstanding. No regrets on my poly education cause I‚Äôve done my best despite my own circumstances. 

Recently friends around me have been getting interview invites and seeing that happening to them is hard-warming, but I actually broke down right after cause it hit me that I highly likely won‚Äôt be getting a spot in Uni. 

I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs has things planned out early and this time round it seems like for once I don‚Äôt? Wanted to apply for overseas Uni to do speech and language therapy/ occupational therapy but after going through an overseas internship stint I realised that I get homesick way too easily & wasn‚Äôt a feasible option. 

Current plan is to wait for rejection letters from unis to come in and then I‚Äôll start applying for jobs in the healthcare ( Community care ) or ncss sector and after that I‚Äôll have 2 options of undergrad studies 

1. Nus adult learner programme to do their FASS degree and major in social work 

Pros: 

nus cert would be more reputable as I may want to pursue masters in ntu‚Äôs gerontology 

Cons: 
only accept applicants with 4 years of working experience pertaining to say that I‚Äôll be 25 when I‚Äôm studying then & only getting a degree when I‚Äôm 28/29.

Have to drop work when I‚Äôm studying this cause it‚Äôs a full time programme 

2. Suss part time social work programme 

Pros: 
Part time programme hence I‚Äôll be able to juggle both work and studies 

Cons:
Degree Might not be recognised by ntu for my masters. 

have sources claiming that suss social work grads don‚Äôt get jobs easily 

I‚Äôm particularly interested in the healthcare sector ( nursing ) but there‚Äôs no private degree for me to do cause it‚Äôs all TOP-ups so I‚Äôll have to start from diploma if I want to pursue nursing but I‚Äôm not keen on doing that hence the shift towards social work.

Hahaha working life really depends on which industry you join. Do what you love, what you‚Äôre passionate about. Don‚Äôt go after money. Take a break from studies. Do your best at work. Experience the working life. Is it the same as what you imagined? Ask yourself, talk to yourself. Make new friends, spend time with family members. While doing all that make use of the time to think what do you want to major in. When you‚Äôre ready, apply for uni while working. If shortlisted you get to practice during interview. If really get offered then you decide again, if not then try again next year. Hahaha don‚Äôt be like me last min rush everything in 2wks.

[A Levels] Some common mistakes students make in General Paper Essays (Abridged),Junior Colleges :karma:,1585803099.0,"Hello! 

So, I'm attempting to pay it forward again for JC students. But before we begin, I'd like to emphasise - please, please, please stay safe. Stay at home as much as possible on your e-learning day. Sanitise your hands regularly!

Anyway, this is an abridged version of my blog post on GP essays . These are some of the common mistakes that should be mitigated as much as possible. The thing about GP - as someone who went through this gauntlet - is that these mistakes, no matter how small they may be, can easily add up. Without further ado, let's get into it!

**#1 - Not defining the key terms and setting parameters in a question** 

This is important as doing so will give you a roadmap for your essay, and potentially open up different interpretations. It may also cause you to think in binary terms. (See below)

**#2 - Vague arguments that do not answer the question**

This means writing stuff like ""Yes, indeed, the government is responsible,"" in response to a question like, ""To what extent is the government responsible for individual welfare""? It's not enough to simply give a stand, you need to be more specific w.r.t. *why the government is responsible*.

**#3 - Balance = Thinking in binary terms**

To many students, balance means an argument and a *direct* counter-argument. This isn't balance - *it's contradiction*. To me, balance means being accurate. In short, we can argue for something, say... ""practice is a very effective way to study"" *while pointing out its limitations*. This is still balance.

**#4 - Narrating examples instead of establishing the link** 

This means giving too much detail on the example, instead of explaining how it proves your point. It prevents you from being concise and staying laser-focused. 

**#5 - Disregarding grammar**

This mistake is something that undermines your language score, sure. But the bigger problem is that it prevents a clear expression of your arguments. It's really simple - if the examiners don't understand what you're saying, they can't give credit where it's due. 

So, yeah. These are, to be honest, elementary mistakes - i.e., you shouldn't be making them. But I'm pretty sure we all space out sometimes and lose our awareness of these things. (Trust me... It happens so many times. Even for me, as an adult.) This post is meant to help you stay aware of these mistakes!

Hopefully this helps. If you have any other questions, do PM me, or you can simply head on over to my blog for the 5 common mistakes on GP [essays](https://www.gpspectrum.com/post/5-common-mistakes-in-general-paper-essays)! (Much more details there, including quick solutions to these mistakes.)

"[UNI] Low cGPA (2.77). Currently working, what options do I have regarding further studies?",University :snoo_smile:,1585797679.0,"I graduated from NYP with a Diploma in Nanotechnology and Material Science in 2018. Currently working in quite a good electronics company as a Senior Technician for almost 1.5 years now. Honestly, I don't really like my job but I don't really have a choice.

I have been thinking of furthering my studies but I am not sure what options I have with my pathetic cGPA. I have been trying to apply all the local Uni (NTU, NUS, SUTD and SIT) since 2018 after I graduated but as you can see, I didn't get in. Trying this year again but I think the results will be the same. I mainly applied for Engineering courses as I'm more interested in those courses especially Science related (I really want to learn something that I'm interested in, but I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't be choosing and just apply whatever I can based on my cGPA, if possible, please advise me!!)

Maybe some background:

* What do my parents think?

Luckily, I have a very supportive family and they are fine with all my choices as long as I'm happy. Even so, I still hope I can further my studies with minimal cost so that I will not burden my family too much.

* Do you have a good portfolio?

I have a relatively good portfolio in Poly? I was the Vice-President of my school club which is event-based. I also volunteer in my temple almost every week. And maybe that's it. I think these won't be enough to get into any local uni here.

Are there other options for me regarding further studies, should I change my path? If no options at all, should I consider overseas studies or should I continue working for a few more years? Feel free to be savage (maybe not too much), I really need some advise and directions.

[O Levels] Please don't undermine private tutors in this time of need,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585795098.0,"I'm a private tutor. I run a small tuition centre. After deducting rent, marketing & administrative costs - I take home around $2500 a month. I teach more than 10 classes weekly.

It has been a very demoralising few weeks.

1. Amidst the suspension of centre-based tuition classes - parents have asked for discount on fees. I tried to help whenever I can by waiving off fees or giving discounts, knowing fully that it will be at my own expense.

Yet, I've received a lot of comments from parents who do not have financial difficulties, going ""e-learning should be cheaper"".

e-Learning IS not cheaper than classroom based learning. It has been 2 sleepless weeks with this mad scramble to move classes online. We've had to to spend sessions doing orientation for you and your children to help explain how to do classes online. We had to buy IT equipment, video recording equipment - all of it not cheap with my measly $2500 monthly salary.

You think it's less effort - it's not. It's more effort and more work. And you want to pay us less.

Please don't undermine our efforts by requesting to pay us less. If you have financial difficulties, we will discount for you. But don't say ""e-Learning should be paid less"". Thanks.

Rental still goes on - landlords who don't take the initiative to help and pass on rental rebates, I'm looking at YOU!

2. We totally understand that why we have been closed down. Health comes first - sure.

However, can don't call us non-essential?

School is essential, tuition is non-essential. Minister said that. True facts of life.

But, but. Can you also see this.

In every sector, there are good people and there are bad people.

In the tuition sector, there are some of us good ones and some of us bad ones.

I dare say, I care about each and every-one of my students. I do my best to motivate. I do my best to talk to them when they have family troubles. I come up with extra worksheets when I know they are lagging behind.

In schools, you also have teachers who are not motivated, who only come to school for the paycheck and do the minimum.

If all school teachers are good - need tuition teachers for what?

If everybody scoring A1, A2 and A\* - then no need for tuition. Some parents find tuition because their kids have been failing.

We don't need you to recognise us. But don't call us non-essential can?

3. Common comment from school teachers and from the public - ""They should pay school teachers more"" or ""Tuition teachers make so much money"".

You know how many times I roll my eyes at this?

Straits Times - I'm looking at you. Thanks for always reporting on ""million dollar"" tutors. Now everybody thinks that all tutors make millions.

Reality check - If you are a school teacher and you think you will make a lot of money leaving the public sector, feel free to go try your luck.

Is every school teacher a Principal? or a Cluster Superintendent? or a Director? No right?

Same thing with the private sector ok? The top tutors make a lot of money. The normal tutors like us make close to the 'median' $4600 of the typical Singaporean.

We don't have CPF.

We don't have AWS.

We don't have performance bonus.

In November & December, we eat bread but still pay rent.

Whatever we earn in 10 months, must ration across 12 months, because November & December parents go holiday and don't want tuition.

No - regular tutors don't make millions.

Stop dreaming. Most school teachers are not zai. If they leave the public sector, they will eat grass.

I make $2500 a month - if you feel that is fantastic, you can be my guest. You have a choice. If you think you can make more as a private tutor, take the plunge into the world of the unknown.

4. Teachers got a lot of admin work, not like private tutor only need to teach

We don't have admin work. We have ""admin work"" - marketing, accounting & trying to keep the business alive. We don't only teach.

You have a 'clear thick' line between yourself and parents. We don't. We are obligated to answer, and talk to parents everyday. Do you know there are parents who call us and talk to us everyday about their kids and their anxieties? (a lot of parents from top schools are actually very anxious about their kids) I spend 1 to 2 hours daily talking to 2 to 3 parents everyday.

5. Thank you for classifying us together with KTVs, Bars & Entertainment

I called the bank to lower my credit card interest because in anticipation of school closures, I invested heavily in video recording equipment and IT equipment that I actually cannot pay for with my measly salary.

Guess what the bank said? You are not from an eligible 'adversely affected' sector.

Adversely affected = tourism, aviation, F&B and entertainment.

Entertainment qualifies but private education doesn't qualify.

Again, i understand why we have been shut down. But can everyone remember us private tutors have families to feed too? Mortgages or rent to pay? Bills to pay?

6. We are human beings too

We have feelings. We have empathy. We have tried to help whenever we can. My tuition centre offers free tuition all these years to whomever are on MOE Financial Assistance scheme. When parents face difficulties (retrenched, fell sick), we always cut our fees or give free. When students ask for extra help, we coach and we don't charge extra.

We are trying our best too. Really. We are all in this together.

I don't know since when being a 'private tutor' is a nasty thing.

Maybe tuition centres like Learning Lab, Mavis Tutorial or any of those big tuition centres with big MRT and bus adverts and sprawling land space of more than 10000 square feet might make millions of dollars a year. Maybe they have strong investors with hundreds of millions. But hey that's not us. Don't assume that we have a mountain of profits to stomach this because we don't.

Also, a lot of our kids and a lot of our parents always tell us that school teachers always say bad things about private tutors. ""Tuition is a waste of money"", ""don't need go for tuition"", ""private tutors are not qualified and don't know what they are teaching"".

Some teachers seem to spend a lot of time bad-mouthing private tutors.

Grass always seem to be greener on the other side.

You get your bonuses, your CONNECT plan, your PB and your 13th month. When the economy does well - you get extra money for doing absolutely nothing extra.

2 to 3 year 'old' Teachers pay around $5k to $6k. HOD teachers pay is ""7k to 10k"". VPs more. Ps on Superscale can make $200+ k per year. Stop making comparisons and keep saying private tutors make more.

Just focus on teaching your kids please. You still have a job.

I may not have one when the dust settles.

Also, remember that a lot of us private tutors were once school teachers.

Some of us left because of school mergers.

Some of us left because we were pregnant, had kids and could no longer cope.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with this thing called EPMS.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with all the politics, committees, organising overseas trips and want to just focus on the kids.

(I mean... come on, really?!)\n\nNevertheless, this is something EVERYONE is going through together, regardless of who they are. I have friends in the gig economy or in the private sector (regularly paid jobs) who have been temporarily laid off. So, we should really engage in constructive dialogue rather than ranting. We can also find ways to adapt, like tightening our belts, or even finding a 2nd job. We work hard to add value to the education landscape - and I firmly believe this pays off in the end, not just for ourselves, but for the younger generation.\n\nStay strong, man.

Am a student myself and my Econs tutor was complaining about how they only had 1 day to react to the shutting down of centres. Everything was rushed and am suprised the lesson turned out smoothly. Really appreciated it. \n\nParents should understand the needs of private tutors at this point of time, and not just exploit the situation in their favour.  But this is easier said than done since most of them do really have a choice to switch tutors/stop tuition eg. and this would put the private tutors at a disadvantage (because of the competitiveness of tuition services in Singapore) to explain to them. \n\nSome school teachers don‚Äôt really bother about students having tuition teachers as to them, its the results that matters in the end. Though this is true, I have had several encounters of secondary sch teachers and jc teachers who speak badly of tuition teachers, saying that they are ‚Äúnot updated with the syllabus‚Äù, does not know the ‚Äúformat that Cambridge expects‚Äù eg. I mean, its the student‚Äôs choice whether to have tuition or not since we are the ones in charge of our own education.

I believe as a full time tutor youself, you know that for sure too. Justifying the additional costs spent on IT stuff is merely a reason to account for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced, but should not be exacerbated as a veto factor for why tuition fees shouldn't be reduced. If online tuition could replace physical tuition/teaching, there wouldn't be a point in having schools right? Moreover with the roll out of HBL/SLS assignments in schools, there is less of an incentive for parents to have their child go for online tuition if teachers in schools right now are doing it also (also helped out in a sch to set up resources for a certain subject too last week, and probably over the course of next few weeks).\n\nJust my two cents worth.

NTU also has similar 6 months or 1 year overseas internship programmes like the OEP as well as other choices providing shorter trips. But I rly want to score the longer 6 month of 1 year programme. Can someone tell me in which uni, is it easier to score those kinda prog?

2) And are they equally as enriching? Bc I read some stuff where students who came back from NUS NOC created some start up successfully. I'm sure people who went on NTU overseas prog also did some amazing work but anyone care to share any that uve heard?

[Rant] Close offices and schools,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585752908.0,"1000 cases. 54 local, 25 unlinked. Yes its incomparable to other countries, but Singapore is small, and very densely populated. With an increase in cases, the hospitals would be unable to take care of these patients as well as before. More people are going to die.

&#x200B;

To restrict all gatherings to less than 10 people and yet still have people go to work/ school is the most hypocritical thing I have heard. We have to be ahead of the virus, not behind it. Keeping offices and schools open when there are other options such as home-based learning is wrong.

&#x200B;

Yes there are many families that are unable to stay at home to take care of their kids, but anything is better than going out to risk catching the disease. Children can spread the disease, and also DIE from it. I am sure no parent wants their child to be the first child to die. If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we? They have schools open for only children whom cannot stay at home.

&#x200B;

The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. You wont ever be able to fix your economy if your citizens have died.

Anything? What about the single mother with two children working multiple part time jobs? How is she to help her children have any sense of normalcy if a sudden shutdown were to be imposed? What about the family in a single room HDB that can‚Äôt afford a computer? If everything shuts down how are they to continue studies and keep pace with everyone else? I think many are speaking from a position of privilege and fail to see that this is a very real existential issue for thousands of singaporean households. What about parents who are at the front line of health care? Do they go back to take care of their children and compromise our primary defence against the virus?\n\n>If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nThe UK, as did most of the West, has completely bungled its response to the coronavirus, and was forced to take draconian measures to stop the tidal wave they introduced. Both the US and UK have also had to cancel national exams, throwing millions of students into a state of uncertainty for their future and ambitions. I think it‚Äôd be fairer to compare public health measures with Taiwan and Japan, for instance. \n\n> The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine. Prioritising the economy over lives is wrong. \n\nI agree that in the long term, public health and the state of the economy aren‚Äôt diametrically opposed. However, it is unfair to compare this to SARS. Look at the US. Relatively unscathed by SARS. For the coronavirus, unemployment claims now stand at more than 3 million, the highest it has been in American history (here‚Äôs a graph as reference: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/3-3-million-americans-filed-for-unemployment-last-week-almost-5-times-the-record-high/) Think about trade-dependent Singapore in that context. Have you gone to the airport recently? Tourism in Singapore is essentially dead. Retail is dead. Disproportionate consequences for the poorest in our society. No rational company will be seeking to employ with these economic conditions. This is projected to be the worst recession in Singapore‚Äôs history. The government has offered unemployment benefits, which it has almost never substantially done in its decades of rule. As the US, Malaysia, China falter, a second wave of economic crisis for us. This is a far more severe economic problem. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs a game of costs and benefits, and the fact of the matter is that the situation is more nuanced than most would likely hope it to be. No perfection to be found on earth. I took a look at your post history and you‚Äôve asked a similar question 2 weeks ago, and commenters there have given very valid points you should have considered"", 'I will just explain why the economy being bad is DIRE. \n\nassuming schools are close, our economy worsens.  this will result in retrenchment. \nand hence, those working in retail,  your taxi uncle or even your waiter will have no job. \n\nwhat will happen to their family? \nthey will have limited savings,  and they have to compete with others to buy for necessities to cope with covid. prices of stuff like toilet paper and staple food HAS risen. and it will continue to rise if economy worsens.  and Singaporeans will panic buy and with their limited savings, they can only buy a few. and i think they will die faster before covid hits them. #hardtruths\n\nwhat will happen to all of us? some of us may not even be retrenched.\n\nbecause we have an increased in the number of needies (you mention theres other way to help them without schools right),govt has to pull more money to help them. they have to spend on 1) delivering the items to them 2)finding out who they are (who got retrenched recently, who is below the poverty line...) 3) spending money to help them get over this tough time\n\nand since money doesnt fall from the sky, this means LESSER funds to go into healthcare. Lesser masks, lesser funds to buy more covid-19 swab, lesser funds to operate the hospital and many more.. \nwhat will that mean?  MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.  MORE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE CURED.  THIS WILL GET OUR OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE LOGISTICS.  OH NO', 'Many ministers and country leaders have said that Covid-19 may drag on longer than expected, even until next year, so do you suggest that we close schools and offices till next year as well? Many schools taking IB are already affected with the cancellation(?) of their exams which could affect their university applications. Are we just going to pause everything we‚Äôre doing till 2020 is over and pretend that nothing has happened?\n\nIMO, with how open Singapore is, there‚Äôs always going to be new cases like how we‚Äôll have to face many waves of cases (eg. China, UK/US), so there‚Äôs not really a way to stop the number to 0 unless you want to stop visitors from coming in and cause our already-slowing tourism industry will continue to dry out.\n\n‚ÄúThe economy will not collapse‚Äù How are you so sure? I actually believe that this is only the start (of Covid-19 and also of the effects on our economy) and many times, the effects will actually continue to spill over even when the outbreak is controlled. If you didn‚Äôt know, Singapore‚Äôs economy already started slowing down in 2019 and there were hints of a possible recession in end-2019 even without Covid-19. Latest release by MAS showed current projection is about -1 to -4% in GDP, drop from the initial projection of -0.5 to -1%, that‚Äôs about 4x. If the schools and offices were to close, the contraction will be even larger and companies may end up forcing their employees to take unpaid leaves if Covid-19 continues.\n\nWhile there may be all the different packages pushed out by the Govt to support all the employers and employees, money doesn‚Äôt drop from the sky. You can‚Äôt expect to keep pulling out money without putting money in, can you? There is a limit to the amount we have in our reserves and we shouldn‚Äôt take them for granted.\n\nMaybe what you can do now is to practice good hygiene and good money habits.', "">If other countries like the UK can do it, why can't we?\n\nplease look at the UK.  is the UK doing anything better than us? \n\n>The economy will not collapse. Look at 2003 SARS we closed the schools, but the economy is fine.\n\nhow naive of you to think that the SARS is comparable to COVID? the SARS is afraid of the heat,  COVID is not.  COVID would not.  SARS lasted for five months and this is already the fifth month of COVID and it isnt getting any better\n\nThe ECONOMY will collapse. Yes we are fine now from the consequences of SARS,  but repercussions are terrible if we completely ignore them after it.  If we have not reach that stage yet,  let's not close them down.

As baseline reference, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, UChicago have around a 5% acceptance rate. Duke, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins around 8%. NYU, Cornell, Tufts around 10-15%. Consider that applicants to these schools are self-selecting, i.e that the acceptance rate is in the context of a immensely talented application pool. Recommend you check which individual schools you want to apply, they release admission rate statistics every year. If you apply for financial aid to need-aware schools, it becomes very, very hard to get in. As an Asian international from an overrepresented country (I assume SG), your application also becomes less competitive. International students make up a relatively small percentage of most US undergraduate college populations as a result. Not to say it‚Äôs not worth applying, but you should know that even considering a 5% acceptance rate, it‚Äôs likely even lower considering those factors :( go to r/intltousa for more info about this and r/applyingtocollege for more general US University stuff\n\n\nNot sure about other international systems though.

Firstly, kudos for surviving JC till now! It\'s not an easy fight, but will be fulfilling in the end.\n\nI was in JC in 2013 and 2014 (and got into NUS FASS in 2015). My first year was fine, but second year was HORRENDOUS. In the beginning of the year, I topped the cohort in my Geog test, but my Physical Geog teacher (who was also my Form Teacher) mocked me in front of my class saying ""You spot topic one right? Thats why you scored so well"". That de-motivated me A LOT and I started scoring badly for Geog. (Like shouldn\'t a teacher be encouraging instead of mocking their students like that?) I also started feeling really de-motivated about studying other subjects in general (I am a person who gets affected easily by what other people say of me). Though I did not score Us, but it was still a failing grade. I scored pretty badly for my tests and prelim, IIRC I scored 40+ or 50+ RP...\n\nHowever, knowing that I have a goal in mind (which is, to enter a Local Uni), I knew that I can\'t continue to fail and waste 2 years of my education. So, I started to look for my teachers (for Math and Econs), and started reading more notes and doing more TYS, When I say look for my teachers, I literally signed myself up for every single ""remedial"" ""tutorial"" classes possible so that I can do more practices and be able to clear my doubts almost immediately if any. Night study was useful too because there would be many students studying together and the atmosphere would be good for studying.\n\nIn the end,  I miraculously scored 75 for A-Levels.

[Scholarships] General Scholarship Interview Board Advice,Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585727685.0,"As the title says. I don't cover the other aspects of scholarship selection process (too many). I assume it is an individual interview board (1 interviewee to many interviewers). My examples are heavily skewed towards scholarships offered by the civil service, but the general principles still apply to private organisations. Can also be useful for general university admission interviews too. Here goes:

&#x200B;

1. Know the scholarship organisation.

Don't go for the interview thinking that CAAS manages healthcare, or that LTA is under MSF. Go to the organisation's website and scrutinise the ""about us"" section, as well as resources on their policies. Summarise it into an easy-to-remember 5W1H about the organisation. Know what the organisation's mission and aims are, as they can be the core to your responses for difficult questions. For example, MINDEF's mission is to ""enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy"". So, if they ask you questions regarding (for example) countries who may be aggressive to us and how we may defend ourselves against them, your answer is literally there. The baseline is deterrence and diplomacy - how do you go about doing that? You just need to build on that foundation and flesh out your thoughts. Know what your organisation stands for, and be creative and flexible within that framework. Of course, this is not saying that you cannot give answers based on alternative foundations. Continuing from the above example, I may think that instead of deterrence and diplomacy, throwing money at the problem works too. However, you will need to have a damned good reason for holding that belief, and you will have to justify it on very solid grounds if you want to go that way. The most extraordinary individuals will have opinions like these.

&#x200B;

2. Be *very* familiar with the issues facing your organisation now, and in the future.

Your scholarship organisation is not looking to give you money for free. You are an investment to them, and you need to show that their investment in you will not be wasted. This means that you need to demonstrate an awareness of problems and policies, so that you can be a future leader in the organisation. I cannot stress this enough. This means you must know the following:

a. What are the problems facing this organisation now, or the problems that this organisation is looking to address?

b. What are the current solutions/policies that are in place, and their limitations?

c. What are the future/foreseeable/potential problems that this organisation will face in the future?

Parts A and B are easy. Just read the organisation's webpage, newspaper articles and other reference materials. You might need to reverse engineer policies to figure out what problem they are addressing, but those are relatively straightforward.

Part C is the most difficult. You need to read up extensively for this. Usually, policymakers will allude to problems that we will face down the road in newspaper articles or parliamentary debates. You can also have your own ideas on the potential problems that may be faced, but make sure its logical. For example, if you're going to be interviewed at MND, land use and availability is going to be a huge concern down the road (it already is now, but it'll only get worse). So, if we need more space to build, what could we do about it? We can either build further upward, or we can go underground. Or we can get more land. Dump more sand into the sea? Create more land between Tekong and the mainland? Turn Singapore's 63 islands into one huge landmass? Annex part of Malaysia? What are the pros and cons of each? Why is one solution perhaps preferred over another, in your opinion? These are the trains of thought that you will need to possess. Again, problem solving and policymaking is a key aspect of your future career, and you can bet that they will test you on this.

&#x200B;

3. Have your own opinion/stance.

What this means is, if the MFA interviewer decides to ask you whether we should support the US or China *in times of conflict*, it is probably not a good idea to say ""I think we should support both/neither"". Even though in practice, yes, we do exactly that during peacetime, the context of the question is forcing you to choose a stance. I am doubtful that they would ask the question minus ""in times of conflict"", because the standard answer during peacetime is very clear, and there's really no need to ask giveaway questions. They want to test your analytical skills, awareness of Singapore's interests, and ability to make a judgement call. You do not want to come across as someone who cannot decide, or makes bad (read: unjustifiable) decisions. Remember, you are being assessed at being a policymaker. You cannot make policy if you can't decide. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions based on your answers too. In addition, after you've committed yourself to a stance, stick to it unless you realise you've made a huge mistake. For example, if you say we should support the US because it's rules based yada yada, then don't give an answer later on that seems to suggest the opposite (eg we should support Russia because Putin is a great guy). However, if you realise you've truly f\*cked up based on the line of questioning you're getting (""why do you say Venezuela is similar to Singapore in terms of corruption?""), then you should withdraw what you've said and accept the new information given to you. It can either come across as you being open minded, or you having said something badly mistaken, depending on what you just said. Which brings me to...

&#x200B;

4. Don't smoke your way in interviews.

The panel of interviewers are career professionals. They know exactly what they are talking about. They likely know that you're trying to bluff them, and depending on how serious they are, they can question you repeatedly until it becomes clear to everyone involved that you're smoking, in which case you're done for. Don't let yourself get into this position - point 2 is key. If they ask you something that you really cannot answer, be upfront about it - I'm sorry but I am not familiar with this topic. Could you give me a background or could we discuss a different topic? If you do this once, it's probably acceptable. If you do this too many times, it means you don't know much about the organisation. Give reasonable and logical answers.

&#x200B;

5. Miscellaneous interview things

First impressions count. Even though interviews are likely to be virtual now, it's not excuse for skimping on the basics. Which means, be early. Not on time. *Early*. Dress appropriately and well. Confidence (but not braggadocio) when the interview starts. Sit up straight. Smile. Hands either clasped on the table or on your lap. No fidgeting. Minimise ums and ahs. You can see yourself on the computer screen now, use it to your advantage in addressing the above. Thank the interviewers for their time at the end. Convey a sense of gratitude that you are called for the interview. Don't be that d\*bag that treats scholarships as a god-given right to you.

When the interviewers ask you to describe yourself, give an elevator pitch (meaning 30 seconds to 1 minute, tops). Who are you, why do you want the scholarship and why you are a good fit for the organisation and vice versa. No one on the board is interested in listening to how you love trains for 5 minutes if you are interviewing at MOH. I wouldn't go so far as to say avoid saying irrelevant things about yourself, but everything you say in this pitch should have a purpose. If you really want to talk about how you have a piano diploma, it should have some link or relevance to the scholarship, else you might as well not mention it.

For personality/character questions, you should prepare for them beforehand. What are your strengths and weaknesses, most inspiring person in your life, a time when you failed and how you recovered, that kinda thing. These are easy to think about, reflect who you are as a person and you should have some idea of how you might answer these questions before the interview.

There are also some interview questions that are... interesting. I've heard of interview questions like ""if you were a tree, what would you feel?"". I have no good answer for how to answer these questions. I get the feeling that these questions are a conduit for you to express your personality/thoughts in a de-personalised way, but imo there are much better ways to ask these questions. If you get them, don't panic and don't make a fool of yourself.

You should also come across as being enthusiastic about the organisation, or at least genuinely interested in it. That can mean having a passion for the job. For example, if you're going for a teaching scholarship, how do you know that it is for you? Maybe you've taught tuition before and really enjoyed the process of giving knowledge to others. That kinda thing. But don't overdo or fake it. It's really obvious when people are doing that.

Usually, the interviewers will ask you if you have questions. It would be good to have one or two. They must not be dumb questions (""where is the headquarters of this organisation? Who's the boss? Do I get lunch breaks?""). They can be questions like, ""what is the best thing about working here? what can I look forward to as a scholar here?"" Convey a sense of curiosity and anticipation (and maybe commitment) to the organisation. It's your last chance to make a good impression.

&#x200B;

Lastly, remember that scholarships are not the end of your journey. If you get it, it's just the beginning. Don't take it for granted that you will get it, and if you do get it, treasure it and don't regret it. I'll hang around the thread to answer questions here and there, if there are any. PMs are welcome too. I'm open to opinions for improvement/criticism of this post too.

[Uni] SPECIALIST DIPLOMA VS PART TIME DEGREE,University :snoo_smile:,1585725552.0,"Hi guys, I am going to ORD this year August. I have a diploma in biomedical engineering, but of course my GPA is pretty **** and i plan to continue to study in this field but I am not sure which one to go for?

I have a few choices:

1) Specialist Diploma: downside is that the intake is every year June and July so i can only get in, the following year due to my ORD date. I would have to wait another year for the next intake. However, i emailed them and they say its possible to exempt some modules if i happen to get into a degree, example SUSS's biomedical engineering

2) Specialist Diploma choice 2: October intake, but might not have exemptions as it is not tied to SUSS‚Äôs modules. (NYP‚Äôs biomedical and pharmaceutical specialist diploma). Would it be worth it? 

2) Just apply for SUSS part time biomedical engineering. Although i prefer studying full time, i think since i cant get in to any of the local uni, this is my best bet.

Does specialist diploma let you have a higher chance of entering a local uni, full time? Is the specialist diploma worth your time?

Can anyone who has decided/ got accepted to overseas medical schools please share your experience  (such as tests u took etc.) And most importantly, how are you planning to afford it? (What are good loans to take, or bursaries/scholarships available?)

(Context: overseas unis are soooo expensive, my fanily is not well off so I will have to handle the fees myself. Got rejected to do local med :/ but not ready to give up the dream!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fsplxn/uni_aususuk_medical_schools/,12,"[""Not studying overseas but perhaps giving my two cents to help you set some expectation straights. Bursary & Scholarships are almost impossible to get for overseas medical education (less President Scholarship) I helped you look into A\\* Scholarship as well but it's also only for local medical studies. Fundamentally, a scholar would have to return to the sponsoring organisation to serve out his/her bonds, but there's no incentives for organisation to sponsor your medical studies because you would have to serve in the hospitals. Also, local universities are producing sufficient doctor for the near future so even less incentives. Your best bet would be to go overseas and study and pay out of your own pocket and hope to apply for MOHH Pre Employment Grant. Again to set out some expectations here, PEG are increasingly harder and harder to get as well ([http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application](http://www.physician.mohh.com.sg/grant/application)) It guarantees you a job back in Singapore upon graduation so win-win I would say. \n\nPrepare to set aside about half a million for tuition + living accommodation if you are set on going down this path. Yes, as a doctor you would definitely be able to afford it *EVENTUALLY.* But note that a HO is paid $3650 gross basic, and MO is paid $4500 + $500 basic. If you include calls and stuff maybe add in \\~$400? An associate consultant is paid around $9000-$10000 but that's provided you made it through residency and you would be about early 30s by then. So math it out roughly on your possible loan repayment plans. Again to set expectations, not everyone would gain a residency spot and a lot ended up as chronic MO and leave the service after 5 years to private practice. But on a brighter side, locum pays about $100/hr and a GP working in a chain get paid about $15k. So actually if you would want to skip all the hospital work, you can go overseas study, do part of your training overseas and return to Singapore to work and earn the sweet and comfy $15k, should be able to pay off your debt fairly quickly if you are smart with your money.\n\nAlternatively you can try for Duke NUS through train programmes with some of the universities or look into other healthcare degrees then pursue Duke NUS again if you are sure this is for you."", 'Are you planning to try local med again?', 'How‚Äôs your BMAT?', 'How are your extracurriculars like? Are they excellent? If you do not mind taking a gap year to do volunteer work and work on your ECs I think that you will stand a higher chance next year if you try again! Especially if you go for internships and such, but it‚Äôll be kind of tough to look for one now considering the COVID-19 situation.\n\nUS Medical Schools are out of the question as they are all Postgrad and you would have to do an Undergrad degree in the US/CANADA/UK first. They are also extremely competitive and to get into the top few you have to have an extremely attractive portfolio as an Undergrad. Since you said that you‚Äôd have to handle the fees yourself I won‚Äôt advice this option!\n\nFor UK generally they do accept A-Level students as long as you achieve a good BMAT/UKCAT score. I‚Äôm not that sure about scholarships though. They do offer scholarships to international students for sure, but that may vary from University to University so you‚Äôd have to do in-depth research! Email them and ask about their scholarships.\n\nI think AUS is one of the most suitable options for you. Their currency is similar to that of Singapore‚Äôs and AUS is also closer to Singapore (in fact poorer now if I‚Äôm not wrong). Their cost of living and tuition fees in general are less costly compared to the UK. You can try Monash. Monash‚Äôs extremely popular for Singaporeans, but you‚Äôd have to take the ISAT. Monash‚Äôs medical program is only 5 years long too so tuition would be more affordable. University of Adelaide costs $500,000 for their 6 year Undergrad medicine. Monash would be a better option if you do intend to head to AUS!\n\nI‚Äôm personally a Polytechnic student. Graduated last year from SP with the Diploma in Biomedical Science and am currently serving my NS. My GPA‚Äôs (3.5) definitely not high enough for local Medical Schools (especially NUS). I honestly don‚Äôt believe in the fact that NUS uses entirely holistic admissions. Ultimately GPA/RP plays a huge role in their decisions. I‚Äôm opting for Postgraduate Medicine which is something you can do as well. It‚Äôll definitely take a longer time - 8 years in total instead of 5 to 6 years, but if you really want to do Medicine I think you should just go for it if nothing else works out. \n\nYou could do a BSc in Life Sciences/Biomedical Sciences/Biological Sciences at NTU/NUS then pursue a MD at Duke-NUS. I think that doctors who attain their Medical degrees at the Postgrad level can make extremely good doctors too, especially with the amount of exposure they can get during their Undergrad years that can make them even more mature. \n\nI‚Äôm personally going to do a BSc in Yale-NUS (waitlisted though) or in the UK/AUS before doing Postgrad Med.

NEW Scholarship Interview [SCHOLARSHIP],Scholarships :snoo_feelsgoodman:,1585684227.0,"This is just a record of what I went through during the NEW scholarship interview recently. I have been trying to find information on this particular scholarship on Reddit but have failed to do so. I hope this post would give future scholarship applicants insight into how the interview works and what can you expect in the interview. I applied for this scholarship in hopes of getting the NEA scholarship so that I would at least have a job after studying environmental studies/ earth sciences in uni since the employment rate and job prospects in general for this area of study is relatively poor. Due to the COVID-19 situation, the interview was also held on a zoom call but I would assume that it is similar to the offline experience. The interview started at around 0830 and there was some orientation ( for us it was the features of a zoom call, but it could be familiarisation of the offline place instead) for about 30 mins. We then proceeded onto our first activity which was held at a group level, with a total number of 8 participants for each interview time slot. This was a case study and us having to come up with solutions to the problem in the case study and presenting our points to the assessors and admin staff. I think the key idea here is to lead the discussion and not be led since there are always assessors watching you, even if you are not aware of it. The first activity was rather simple, with many heads contributing ideas, it wasn't hard for us to reach a satisfactory answer at the end of 20 mins. We then had a 5 min break.

The next activity was done at a smaller group level ( the interviewees being split into 2 separate teams ). Here, we were presented with a case study and we had to engage in discussions to support our give topic sentence. We had to debate with the other team and argue for our case ( think of it as an essay where you are discussing the for and they are discussing the against). Once again, it is important to show initiative as the assessors will not know you have good ideas until you voice them out. Do not be shy since everyone is probably as nervous as you are. During this activity, stay on topic and not just ramble on and on about what you have learnt in school, this caused a lot of time to be wasted during my discussion period as 1 of the candidates vomited out what he had learnt in school, without any thought of the question ahead. The debate part was fun, and once again do not be afraid to speak up as you might be seen as lacklustre due to your lack of motivation and participation. There was a 5 min break after this.

The last activity was an individual presentation where we had to come up with a solution to tackle the problem while taking many other factors into consideration. This was quite stressful as you were alone and will only be given 20 min to prepare a word document or PowerPoint slide for the presentation. The presentation includes 3 mins of presentation time and 2 mins of Q&A session. This can be quite fun if you have unique ideas that you think will catch the assessors' eyes. Don't forget to speed through the presentation as you probably will not have enough time to present all that you have prepared. Be ready to think on the spot as the assessors will throw you questions regarding your presentation, and some of the questions can be a curveball that could ruin your otherwise perfect interview.TLDR: the interview was fun and just have fun. I believe that if you have what it takes, you will strive no matter what conditions you are placed under.I hope this post will give you information and further insight into the NEW scholarship interview.

Hello everyone. I‚Äôm not going to reveal my identity here at this platform but I just need some help/suggestions from you guys. I am a 17 year old teen. So what I‚Äôve just found out recently was that my mother had ‚Äústolen‚Äù $550 away from me, without my consent/permission, (she just kept quiet as if nothing has happened) which was my savings and my Ang pow money collected in 2019 and 2020.

Say u have C2H6O, u can draw it as ethanol or CH3-O-CH3. Basically means that u shift O in between the carbons. Can‚Äôt really put this one in words soz :‚Äô)\n\nNext, positional isomers! It just means like attach the group that u got like CC double bond or -OH group onto different carbon atoms. Take butene for example, now there are 2 ways to draw it, which is the double bond between carbon 1 and 2, and another way is between carbon 2 and 3. \n\nLast, chain isomers! It‚Äôs really just branching out the straight chain. Let‚Äôs use but-1-ene (double bond between carbon 1 and 2) so the only way u can branch it out is 3 carbons in a straight line and one carbon branched out and u get 2 chain isomers (including the original, the 4 carbon straight chain)! \n\nI use this method for JC chem so tbh i think the first step isn‚Äôt really that impt for sec sch but yeah! Hope my explanation is clear enough :‚Äô) feel free to ask me if u don‚Äôt understand anything :))', ""That's a good method. If I may add a suggestion, it's probably more useful to flip the chain and position steps.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve identify the carbon backbone, all you need to do thereafter is to permute the position of the functional group.\n\nI think that‚Äôs easier than to rearrange the C-skeleton without affecting the position of the FG. You're also less likely to get repeated structures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing pentanol as an example (I‚Äôll be skipping the functional group isomerism):\n\n3 possible chains: pentane, 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylpropane.\n\nA permutation of the possible positions results in the [following 8 isomers](https://imgur.com/a/tWQhGxr).""]","[1585668444.0, 1585700757.0]","[7, 2]"

"[uni] applications: many concerns, a little regret?",University :snoo_smile:,1585645586.0,"soooo 

after a level results came out (i scored 73.75rp, arts stream in jc), i basically thought i had all the time in the world and didnt think much about uni applications... until the last week. didnt think about so much then bc i was quite happy with my grades until i realised (recently) that many many many people did so much better and i'm just one out of the many candidates. 

i submitted my application to 4 universities (big 3 + SUSS) at 11pm plus on 19 march, and looking back, idk if i made the right choice in terms of putting my choices. my application to the university had all the personal statement + essays for ABA/DA. all of cut offs listed below are the 10th percentile of the courses. 

NUS 
1) FASS (cut off 75)
2) project facilities / real estate (cut off both 71.25) 

SMU 
1) social science, PPS then PLE (cut off 73.75)
2) info systems (cut off 73.75) 

NTU
1) public policy and global affairs (cut off 75rp) 
2) sociology (cut off 72.5)
3) philosophy (cut off 70) 

SUSS 
1) public safety and security
2) social work with minor 

i see people getting offers left and right, and so far i've been contacted by SMU for an interview, and i dont think i did well for it. lowkey stressed now bc i'm afraid i'm not good enough to get to FASS in NUS, and that NTU will take extremely long to contact me given that i'm below their 10th percentile for my first choice, and idk how their offering system works for second choices. my friends who put PPS for SUSS have already gotten emails saying that they were rejected for PPS and they'll be interviewed for their second choice, but i havent heard anything. (friend's rp is 65 onwards). told my other friends about it and they were like ""aiya you apply SUSS when you got chance of going to the big 3, they confirm wont get back to you cause they think you'll reject them what"". 

so now, i'm just lost, anxious, concerned. i'm hoping for some truthful and genuine advice here, and not just ""i'm sure you'll get somewhere eventually dont fret about it xx"" (although thank u for the encouragement!)

[Uni] [SIT Physio] Summary of Kira Interview,University :snoo_smile:,1585628138.0,"Hi everyone, I'm applying for SIT Physiotherapy, and just completed the video interview. Want to share a few things as I've seen people asking about it.

1. I only got 2 practice questions. I thought that they would randomly pick 2 from a pool and change everytime i refresh, but nope, only those 2 practice questions.

2. They say that there are 18 questions, but a few questions just provide the background for upcoming questions, so overall its less.

3. There is a 30min essay component!!! I did not expect this and was not prepared for this...

4. The questions at the start gave u a TOUGH situation and asked how u will react to this situation, what u feel etc.

5. In the middle there are 2 roleplay sessions. The roleplay basically gives you the background brief, and then shows a video of a person roleplaying(for me he was acting like an elderly citizen complaining to me abt an issue). You have to stay in character to your role and try to reply to him, and then in a next video they will ask you on your thoughts abt the situation. As a physio applicant, I mainly got more social services-type questions.

6. The questions at the end of the interview ask the generic questions, e.g. what are your strengths and weakness, why should we pick you, etc.

7. Some ppl have said there was a 2min time for u to write more things at the end, mine wasnt written but was a video for u to say anything for qn 18.

8. Generally the questions gave you 10 seconds to prepare your response, and then 2 mins for your reply.

9. I completed the entire thing in 1h15min.

10. They also ask you on why you picked your specific course vs other healthcare roles offered by SIT.

i went to clarify with my friend‚Äôs lecturers (he‚Äôs in NUS YLL and two of his lecturers teach in Duke-NUS) and they said maybe what he meant was , he actually intended to apply for Duke-NUS or post-grad medical school after his undergrad . but they said that the chances of him even getting into these schools are very low to nil because:

1) they don‚Äôt traditionally accept students from part time undergrad courses
2) they have never accepted students from SUSS which can be seen [here](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/images/default-source/admissions/class-profile---universities.jpg?sfvrsn=8389ccec_0) 
3) the MCAT (entrance exam to Duke-NUS) is notoriously hard and SUSS does not prep you enough for it even if you self study 

is this true ?? can someone pls help me with this , because i am genuinely concerned . because i am now considering on taking a part time undergrad course at SUSS to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor too ??",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fs1b5p/uni_med_school_from_suss/,10,"[""he's lying through his teeth. duke-nus only has programmes with smu, sutd, ntu and nus (and yale-nus). Also, they're pre-MD programmes, not MD ones. and common sense tells us that anyone whose grades are good enough for med sku would not even consider SUSS, let alone a part-time programme there. there also isn't any time for simultaneous studies.\n\nfor your case, i understand your concern. there are many people here who have had the dream to become a doctor created in them either by nature or nurture. some succeed, some don't. for you, unfortunately, all the facts are going against you. i'd just like to add on that even full-time SUSS degrees have nowhere close to the rigour of other big unis in Singapore. Part-time courses have even less. \n\nYes, you may be able to do all the non-medical jobs that the MD folks did before joining the course, and yes, your work experience can be advantageous in the selection process. But above all, medicine is a very textbook-heavy course (at least at the start) and your academic standing has to be top tier to be able to handle the massive amounts of content that the course has. There's a reason why SUSS is called the uni of Self Study. The rigour just isn't there.\n\nI apologize if I sounded rude, but that's the truth I gathered from asking med sku department heads (overseas) and medical lecturers locally. No school is going to risk wasting public/donor funds on someone who has not proven his academic abilities. If you have money, maybe you could go an overseas uni, do a foundation year (and do well) and study MBBS there. Saves you time but will probably cost you half a million in total.

I didn't want to take H2 maths as my maths background isn't so strong and I didn't want it to take a toll on my other H2s.

Additionally, my profs are really high up in their field and have several connections in the industry, allowing us to go behind the scenes of several museums. But I think it‚Äôs most important to look at the modules of the course you plan to do and see if you‚Äôre interested in them/think you‚Äôll enjoy it. No point going overseas if you‚Äôre not gonna like the modules imo.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel feel to PM :)', 'Hi! A fellow artstream student as well who applied to UK unis ~ \nYour school might have done a briefing on UK unis so they do put in place internal deadlines for applications. Generally for oxbridge you definitely have to apply early such as maybe even before Prelims. You can ask your school if you are allowed to apply later if you wish to spend the time focusing on A levels as the deadline for UCAS for most unis is if Im not wrong, January 15. Just always update your teachers as their referrals are important and you would need their help crafting your personal statement.\nYour CCAs and other external activities are definitely impt in your application so dont be discouraged you only take 3 H2s , my friend got accepted into the in UCL and the history course of Edinburgh and she only took 3H2s. \n\nAlso, whether it is worth it honestly depends on your own self. Sg unis are good enough, truly and thats what made me decide to stay here in Sg in the end. Sg unis have many scholarships to help lighten the load. For now, try to search up scholarships that you could potentially apply for to help lighten the financial burden of studying in the UK ! Studying abroad is definitely a wonderful experience but you‚Äôd want to be practical and confirm if your parents are onboard etc', 'Hi! I got offered for UCL (amongst other schools) for linguistics! It‚Äôs very exciting to see another linguistics student-to-be :-) The other answers give good general advice so mine‚Äôs more specific to linguistics.\n\n1. I think sufficiently answered by all the other comments!\n\n2. Since universities like UCL and Edinburgh will only need 3H2s to assess their conditional offer you should be fine with 3H2s! The downside is that you need to score well in all of your H2s and don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù H2 to swap out. In fact I think linguistics isn‚Äôt that competitive a course because all my linguistics conditional offers were AAB, so as long as your UCAS statement is reasonable and you have a good teacher reference I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so competitive that they‚Äôd disadvantage you for being 3H2. The UK schools really don‚Äôt look at your extracurriculars at all, so it‚Äôs a bit strange that the other comments said so. If anything, CCAs only matter for US applications. \n\n3. Look at the courses and specialisation you want in linguistics carefully, and match the schools based on it! I personally didn‚Äôt apply to Oxbridge because (from what I understand on the website) they are very anglocentric and theoretical in their type of linguistic focus (and Oxford doesn‚Äôt even offer it on its own because its combined with Philosophy and Psychology), whereas I wanted to do more applied and quantitative linguistics (computational, experimental, etc) especially in East Asian languages. For this UCL has an Experimental Linguistics course so it suited me perfectly. Locally NTU was a better choice for me because their LMS course covers a wider range of languages and leans towards applied fields, whereas NUS‚Äô only focuses on English linguistics. Edinburgh is a top school for linguistics but it is a straight 4 year MA Linguistics course, so I didn‚Äôt apply for it because I would hope to do an MA in another country.\n\nSo between studying here and overseas, maybe if your specialisation is something that can only be pursued overseas that gives you an easier answer. For instance if you‚Äôre into corpus linguistics Edinburgh has a whole research lab on it while NTU only has one module. There‚Äôs also a question of faculty‚Äîmaybe there‚Äôs a prof at UCL who does research in the area you‚Äôre interested in, but no such profs at NTU. That‚Äôs very important because your profs determine the kind of niche classes you can be exposed to and the kind of undergrad research you can do. For instance I‚Äôm very interested in sign language linguistics and UCL has one faculty with it as their specific research area, and they also have one faculty from Japan who could be a great advisor if I want to do a thesis in East Asian/Japanese languages.\n\nAlso of course, the general appeal of living overseas and learning independence, as the other comments have mentioned.', ""1. I think most schools have powerpoint slides on their website with the timeline for US/UK applications that are available to the public. For oxbridge the deadline is sep/oct for the rest is jan\n2. Yea go for it, as you said 4H2s is not a requirement. You can make up for it with extracurriculars.\n3. I hope so. It's probably best to get some kind of scholarship if it's a stretch to afford it, but even if I don't get one I think I'll still go. Just live on bread and water lol.""]","[1585578916.0, 1585580829.0, 1585616932.0, 1585581916.0]","[3, 2, 2, 1]"

Not too sure if they changed it since my batch but ill just share my experience for the interviews here. \n\nFirst, youll need to do an essay. There were 3 questions for mine and a single A4 paper page limit. You can choose to answer any of the 1 out of 3 questions provided. The main aim we discerned after getting into SIT was that they mainly just wanna look at your ability to critically think and reason, which is extremely important to develop going into the healthcare industry. \n\nNot sure if this is still here since its online now...\n\nSecondly, this is the Multiple Mini Interviews(MMI) there were 4 stations for mine \n\nEach station you are given 2 minutes to read through a prep sheet and then you are given 8 minutes to speak. HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU SPEAK FOR ALL 8 MINUTES.\n\nFrom my experience, the following were the general questions they asked for each station(its been awhile so i cant really remember but ill try) \n\n1. General healthcare : they asked about how you think technology has helped the healthcare industry and about medisave/shield. \n\nMy advice: Read up about the basic healthcare system and how it works in singapore.Understand the general principles of the different schemes that the govt has set up for citizens. \n\n2. A critical thinking scenario : a story was given to me about being a patient and encountering a doctor that smelt like alcohol whilst talking to him. They want to know what would you do if you encounter difficulty in the field. \n\nMy advice: Go back to basics on your fundamental morals. Know your right from wrong and the gray in between. Empathise always. \n\n3. Course specific interview: They gonna ask u about the course you applied for. \n\nMy advice: know what an RT does. Know the main purpose of our job( ans: pain relief) and tell them why u want it so bad. \n\n4. Healthcare related: They asked about how the healthcare system works. Like the flow\n\nMy advice: know how people get from the doctor to the hospital and what happens after they get discharged. Like the entire process. \n\nFinal thoughts : tbh i didnt expect to get in and its been a whirlwind of fun and craziness and insanity. But i love it lol. Please think this through if u wanna enter this course because it is very very niche. And youll end up working in the field for a while if you choose to stay. As a year 3, I feel about half my class is ready to leave the industry as soon as we graduate. Its mostly a mixture of jadedness and burnout and lack of motivation.

so yea i‚Äôm just feeling q depressed and lonely rn bc i‚Äôm seeing how my other jc schoolmates hang out and gather together frequently on ig stories, and i‚Äôm rly envious of them to still hang tgt even after school & exams. it‚Äôs such a blessing to have a constant group of close friends to hang out with frequently 

don‚Äôt tell me to not compare because really, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that toxic / bad to be envious of others and self reflect once in a while

and it‚Äôs not like i can really ask my jc friends out because like i said we don‚Äôt rly vibe (and i cant rly be bothered to try too cos i know we can‚Äôt force connections) i still keep in touch w my sec sch friends but we‚Äôre rly just acquaintances who will meet once or twice every few months 

and for the very few 2-3 friends who i can rly vibe well with, we haven‚Äôt see each other for a v long time so it‚Äôs kinda awkward to ask them out and hang 1 on 1 for like a few hrs (it‚Äôs like a temporary getaway from the feeling of being lonely and that‚Äôs about it, kinda pointless imo) 

what i wld want is a close knitted group of friends where everyone connects well with each other and wld hang frequently (once every 1-2 weeks)? where we wld sustain a constant communication via texts, and u can rly tell anything to and confide in, not those friends who u know will be ‚Äúthere‚Äù when u hit them up kinda thing u know? it just hits different 

i‚Äôm also q an introverted person who takes time to open up, but once i rly connect well with u and open up i‚Äôm q fun to be around with (taken from one close friend of mine LOL) so ya i don‚Äôt think i suck at maintaining friendships, it‚Äôs more of the introductory making friends part that‚Äôs hard to me

sooo i was just wondering if it‚Äôs still likely to find constant non-fleeting friendships in university bc from what i read you don‚Äôt rly get to stick with the same bunch of friends all the time unlike in pri sch to jc, and coupled w the heavier workload, it makes friendships harder to maintain

i just don‚Äôt want to graduate and step into the working society lonely af without gaining a constant group of friends from my education lol :,,)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr6gz3/postexamsuniversity_is_it_still_possible_to_find/,158,"[""Can but it's harder like u must rly rly rly try haha. I guess I have a few close Uni friends haha. \n\nDon't worry I wasn't really close with my JC friends too but I went overseas with them anyways haha üôÉ"", 'omg are we the same person xD\nbut seriously tho, i think as long as u be urself,im sure you can find some close friends, like they are ppl from all walks of life in uni, unlike jc , so i do think its possible.gdluck!!', 'Definitely! I found a really close group of friends in my faculty and we are still close even after (disrupted) exchange and we are going into our final year soon. \n\nIt could be because my faculty is small and we have to take a lot of core mods together, so we spend a lot of time studying for the same modules.\n\nEven so, I think that uni is a good place to forge lasting friendships, because\n1) People are more mature than in JC (hopefully LOL)\n\n2) The different projects/groupwork/activities in your modules or CCA mean that you get to interact with different people all the time, hence it‚Äôs easier to find people you vibe with. If you don‚Äôt vibe with them, you‚Äôre not stuck with them forever either. This makes the experience different from JC because I felt like I was stuck seeing the same bunch of people in JC (and only remain close friends with a few after JC). \n\nDon‚Äôt be disheartened, and look forward to uni! All the best <3', 'Hi! I struggled so much w this.. am currently finishing year 3 in uni. \n\nHonestly, hall friends are very transient. You‚Äôre close to them mostly because of proximity. The real determining stage of whether you‚Äôre more than hall friends is whether you have heart-to-heart talks and whether yall hang out tgt outside of school even after yall aren‚Äôt in the same hall anymore.\n\nI‚Äôve actually gotten much closer to my course mates! Anyway the bottom line is just be yourself, be genuine and you will attract the people that vibe with the real you. Don‚Äôt try to be someone you‚Äôre not to fit in (if you don‚Äôt like to drink alcohol you don‚Äôt have to force yourself, for example) so that you don‚Äôt waste time with a group of friends that doesn‚Äôt truly suit you.\n\nGood luck for uni!!', ""I didn't expect this but staying on campus has been the most wonderful choice I've made. The people in my RC (NUS) impress me time and time again with how we can discuss anything. Some of them inspire me.\n\nIf you don't stay on campus then yes, it's challenging, but not impossible. It takes consistent, mindful effort to have meals and study together. But uni is so big and honestly, there's bound to be someone you can click with.\n\nIf you stay on campus I think friendships just form and strengthen very naturally bc we are always in such close proximity to one another :)"", 'Always make the effort to keep close contact. \nEven if you think you dont rlly vibe well,always try because you nvr know HAHA\nSome ppl take longer time to warm up to others so you may discover a different side once yall get closer', 'Hey, i had the same worries as you also as i did not really fit well with my JC class. One of the fastest way to get a ""clique"" fast would be to stay on campus halls/RCs since you have a bunch of people you can interact with daily, that said don\'t try to be someone you are not, just be yourself and make youself comfortable among ur peers. However, remember that friendships are a two way thing, no matter how much effort u put in, if the other party doesn\'t seem interested in returning the favour, it might be best to move on and forge new friendships elsewhere. As someone did not stay on campus, i threw myself into many freshmen activities in the hopes of making new friends and connecting with seniors, one thing i realised quickly is that everyone else (esp those who don\'t stay on campus) are also finding friends to be with and form cliques. The first sem is usually where most ppl are still finding their groups to be with and open jio-ing on your orientation group for ppl to bid moudles is a good start. I started my first sem going to lectures and tutorials alone but throughout the sem i asked people who i knew from orientation if they wanted to study together and grab dinner, and now i have a small but close group of friends (can be counted with 1 hand haha) that i rely on for support whenever shit hits the fan. Don\'t stress too much, everyones in the same boat as you!! I\'m sure you will find a close group of friends to last a lifetime, just take initiative to ask! :)', 'yes u can. \n\nI encourage you to take part in the freshmen orientation activities (hopefully they can still happen this year). 80% of my uni friends came from this and super glad I met them because they‚Äôve helped me through so much in school. \n\nI cant emphasise enough how impt it is to make good friends in uni because without them i‚Äôd probably have dropped out of school by now coz of the stress. \n\nRC/ Hall is a good way to make friends too.', ""Unlike JC or secondary school where friendship just forms on its own, you have to put in much more effort into building and maintaining it.\n\nYou probably won't be taking the same set of modules as everyone else in your major, and even for the same module, there could be multiple lecture slots and multiple tutorials. Even then, it's free seating so anyone you meet in class would be pretty transient. It's not like JC where you stay with your classmates most of the day for the whole week.\n\nBecause of this, you kind of need to proactively join CCAs, camps, and initiate conversation to start up friendships. After that, you got to maintain it by occasionally chatting them up or meeting them. Of course, this goes both ways so the other party must be willing to see you as a good friend too.\n\nDon't expect it to be any easier than JC but if you put in effort, it's not too bad."", ""tbh yes! changing tutorial groups every sem sucks big time but my friends and i (5 of us) put in the effort to sit together during lectures, and we try to get the same tutorial slots if possible. if not, at least one or two tutorials where we're grouped together is good enough! don't be afraid to make new friends in your lectures and tutorials:)"", 'HAHAHHA I‚Äôm in the same boat! but I blv it‚Äôs possible :)', 'Bruh I feel you, I‚Äôm damn worried about making friends in uni too.

An application that captures images in the event to remind the audience of smth important', 'i would say a physical prototype wld be better as a community event can be quite common and having a physical prototype can be more unique! can appeal to the markers better', 'i personally wouldn‚Äôt say that one solution is harder than the other but what i can advise in choosing your final solutions is how they complement each other! you should consider how your solutions are linked to one another. for example, if you are raising awareness through a campaign, does your other solutions then help people to take action AFTER gaining awareness of the issue (since gaining awareness might not lead to people changing their actions)? you might want to consider the limitations of your other solutions and see whether your final solution can solve those limitations :D\n\njust a side note (this is my observation from other groups), i think community events require more ideas because usually having one activity is not sufficient, but is less demanding in terms of  ‚Äúdesigning‚Äù. for apps, you also need to have a few functions to meet a bigger aim (so if your app just make a process faster since it is online, it might be too simple to be considered a full solution). you might need to put in more work too in terms of designing the interfaces and labelling your diagrams (my group had quite a lot of interfaces that took a while to do). for physical products, it is simpler in the sense that it is literally one object. but that means you have to provide details on every single part of the object (e.g. why a machine has a sensor, why it is built in a certain shape, how will it adapt for different environments) so there‚Äôs a lot of focus on the details and their purpose.', 'Physical prototype in my opinion cuz you can show the audience by passing it around during Oral presentation.

"[O Levels] 189 for PSLE, 12 raw for OLevel L1R4",O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585466199.0,"Hello! I know getting a l1r4 12 raw for olevel may not be very good as there are way many more ppl getting single digit for r4 and even r5! But to me, I feel that my results are quite desirable and I‚Äôm happy with what I‚Äôve achieved!
4 years ago, I got a 189 for psle but I wasn‚Äôt feeling dejected or disappointed(probably because I was still too young at the age of 12). I didn‚Äôt study for psle and I didn‚Äôt care about my results and how i‚Äòve fared for psle. I got a D for Science, C for English, C for Math and C for Chinese. Yes, I failed Science üòê But I thought getting a 189 was good enough, until I realised that many doors were closed for express stream. A mere 188 is the least to achieve in order to get into an express stream in a neighbourhood secondary school. However, I was glad that I achieved 189 for psle, and not lower(if not unable to even get into express stream). I even selected the NA stream for some schools, just in case I couldn‚Äôt get into my first few express stream choices. I got into a neighbourhood secondary school(cop was 188). It was then I realised how badly I‚Äôve fared for psle(when I started sec 1 and my friends started comparing psle results). My friends had close to 200, even some with 200+
Secondary school was a fresh start for me and I decided to work my ass off to achieve good grades for olevel. Despite failing Science in psle, I had the opportunity to take Pure Science during Sec 3, surprisingly! I knew things were gonna be difficult if I took double pure science, but I took up the challenge(pure phy and pure chem) and I‚Äôm glad I did! Although there were a few times I felt like giving up and dropping to combined science, I persevered through and WOW like I have never gotten a B for Pure Science before but shockingly in OLevel I did! From upper sec onwards, I had alot of tuition classes, like ALOT ! AMath, EMath, Pure Chem, Pure Physics, English, Chinese. My weekends were packed as heck(with classes starting as early as 9am and ending at 5pm on Saturdays). I had many sleepless nights in upper sec and I drank lots of coffee to keep myself awake. I would always stay up to revise especially when exams are on the next day. I know, this is my bad habit. I love to cram the night before and I even did so during the olevel period. But this was the only method that worked for me, so I had no choice. I stayed up for Common Tests, MYE, Prelims, and OLevel. I lost many hours of precious sleep but I tried my best to stay up only when necessary. I sat for Olevel in 2019 and when I received my results 2 months ago, I was shocked to see myself getting a 12 raw for r4 and 16 raw for r5. A1 for AMath, EMath, Chinese, C6 for English(HAHA but glad I didn‚Äôt fail though), B3 for Combined Humanities, B4 for Pure Chemistry. I decided to continue my education via the poly route and is currently waiting for poly semester 1 to start in April.
What I would like to say is that, psle grades don‚Äôt define you(maybe even olevel too). However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt put in hard work and not take exams seriously. A quote I live by especially during olevel period was: Work Hard, Play Hard. It is okay to rest and procrastinate for some days, I do as well! Everyone is a human being and we get tired on some days as well. Don‚Äôt drain yourself too early though(advisable to revise part by part) 
Always do and COMPLETE your TYS !! Review questions that you made a mistake, clarify and ask questions if you‚Äôre unsure, NEVER leave doubts !!! Thanks for reading till here. To all those who are taking Olevel this year, or the upcoming years, wish you all the best and believe in yourself! üí™üèª‚ò∫Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr1wsc/o_levels_189_for_psle_12_raw_for_olevel_l1r4/,149,"[""PSLE doesn't mean anything.

For students who are using a combination of loans &/or subsidies to settle their MOE subsidised tuition fees, the disbursement sequence is as follows:

-Mendaki Tertiary Tuition fee Subsidies (MTTFS) where applicable

-PSEA funds where applicable

-CPF funds under the CPF Education Scheme where applicable

-Study Loan (SL) where applicable

(i take 4h2 pcme btw) can some seniors share their experiences or what makes them want to take up law and how did you decide that‚Äôs what you wanted to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqya90/uni_is_law_the_one_for_me/,3,"['Hi OP! I graduated from a local law school last year and I remember being in the same position as you back in JC.\n\nMy overall advice to you is to just follow your interest and try for law school! As clich√© as it sounds, **you won\'t know unless you try**. I know it\'s daunting because at the age of 16/17, you haven\'t had enough life experience and yet you have to decide on a university course - which has a bearing on your future. But life is a continual self-discovery process and it\'s all trial-and-error. And we all grow as individuals and our interests can change from time to time, so even what you want now may not be what you want say 5 years down the road. But that\'s perfectly ok! You currently have an interest in law and that\'s a good starting point for you to choose where to go. If you subsequently find that law is not for you, you can always change course or change your career direction. I have several law school batchmates who discovered that law wasn\'t for them and moved on to other areas (such as IT). Ok my point is that: (1) you don\'t have to be absolutely certain that law is for you before you opt for law as your uni course choice; (2) there\'s no way you can be absolutely certain and (3) there is always flexibility in switching out of law if you dislike it.\n\nI know there is notion that ""you have to be passionate about law"" before opting for law school. I completely disagree with this. As I mentioned, I believe that passion can change and that passion can also be cultivated. I also find that this term is not helpful to a young student who is still exploring his interests in life. What I do however believe is that law is a very vast diverse field and that there is something in it for most people. You won\'t find yourself interested in all areas of the law. But as long as you are curious about learning about the world or about people, there\'s bound to be an area of law that you are interested in. Because ultimately, there are many legislation/regulations on all (if not most) areas of our lives and economic sectors. For example, if you are like a tech geek who likes to read about the latest products and innovations and are interested in news (such as the dispute between Apple and Creative), you may like patent law. If you like a budding investor who likes to read up about shares and mergers (Grab-Uber), you may like corporate law. If you are passionate about social issues like s 377A or the mandatory death penalty, you may like criminal/ constitutional law. If you like reading about controversial issues such as euthanasia and abortion, you may like medical law. If you like reading about global issues such as Rohingya crisis, you may like public international law. There\'s just so many areas of law that you definitely will find sth you like! So I don\'t think that you shouldn\'t be overly concerned that you would lack interest in the law. \n\nBut of course if you are curious about how law is like - just pick up a law textbook. It doesn\'t have to be a law textbook for law students because the legal jargon might turn you off. You can even pick up say a Business Law textbook for business students. Or you can pick up a criminal law textbook (I believe most people will find crim as a more lively and interesting area of law). Anything you think you would be interested in really. If you are curious about the practice of law, you can take up an internship with a law firm. I think there\'s this Singapore Academy of Law JC programme thingy where you can shadow a lawyer. Or you can write in to a law firm - but they may make you photocopying lol. But that\'s ok because you get to see what the work environment is like. But anyway the practice of law on the other hand is different from law school and another beast altogether - I\'m at this stage right now (as a trainee) and it has been painful lol. \n\nBut that being said, I do think the study of law is NOT for everyone. I can\'t emphasise this enough - **if you hate reading and writing, stay away from law school**. How the law works is that the court follows common law (i.e. previous court decisions) or statutes (e.g. Penal Code). So you will have to read lots of textbooks, court judgments (which can go up to hundreds of pages) and academic commentaries on how to interpret statutes, etc. You will basically be a bookworm stuck in the library throughout law school. You will be reading, reading and reading. And law school doesn\'t just want you to know what the law is - you are expected to also think what the law should be. So you have to be prepared to read a lot to make an informed opinion on various legal issues. And you have to write a lot - like legal memos, research papers of 6,000 words, etc. Trust me, you will be fucking miserable in law school if you hate thinking, reading and writing and communicating. And this probably applies for all courses but especially so for law school - if you hate studying in general, don\'t go to law school. \n\nAnyway I just want to say that law school is extremely tedious (it makes JC look easy on hindsight). So you must be prepared to work your ass off if you want to go to law school. But it\'s extremely rewarding at the same time and I feel like I have gained so much from law school and became a better thinker. So notwithstanding the challenge, I would still highly encourage you to go to law school if you are interested in law!\n\nOk I\'m sorry Idk how I ended up typing so much haha. But I hope this helps. And OP, all the best in JC and in finding your direction! Just chill and enjoy your JC life for now. I\'m sure everything will work out in the end!', ""You still have quite some time before you have to make a decision. I would suggest that you take up an internship during the school holidays (this applies to nearly every discipline, not just Law).\n\nYou won't be doing much since you have little to no legal knowledge but you'll get to see the rigour of practice. Go for smaller firms because they're usually more willing to mentor you. Iirc, there's also a Junior College Law Programme that's open to JC students."", ""Speak to lawyers? Hit me up if you want an intro and connection. I'm surrounded by lawyers lol."", 'thank you so much! and also if i like the process of studying a subject like gp, do u think it‚Äôll make the tedious process of studying for law easier? i am interested in law, but the amount of studying, reading, writing seems a little daunting and scary ngl. but i also get how it will be rewarding after it all.', 'Haha np! Yes, I do think that there\'s a high chance you\'ll enjoy studying law if you enjoy studying GP! Studying for law and GP would be similar as both require you to perform research, read and analyse various differing opinions on the same issue, and form your own opinion and argue it persuasively. I would say GP trains you well for law!\n\nI also think it helps indirectly if you enjoy your science subjects. Some parts of law can be quite ""sciencey"". Because in many law school exams, they give us like a hypothetical scenario and ask us to advise a client. So we always have to refer to previous court decisions and argue whether those cases are similar/different to our given scenario and then conclude how the law should apply. I think it\'s similar to science cos we also study certain concepts/theories and have to apply them to our exam questions.', 'oh i see, that‚Äôs cool! thanks again!', 'are you studying law at the moment? in nus?', 'I graduated from NUS Law last year! :)', 'ahh I see, cool!']","[1585464839.0, 1585457817.0, 1585619406.0, 1585465624.0, 1585468728.0, 1585476544.0, 1585476592.0, 1585486212.0, 1585516894.0]","[21, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1]"

[JC] Rant about something's that's been on my mind for a while,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585412516.0,"
Hi, so I'm a J1 student and I've been enjoying my school life so far, having made a lot of friends (far more than I had when I was in sec sch and poly) and everyone in my class just seems really nice and friendly and I could get along with all of them pretty well. There's hardly any segregation into cliques in my class, so I'm really happy and grateful for that because I've never experienced that before in my whole life.

Until a few days ago.

Context: I'm the type of person to overthink things a lot and I've been trying to push it down ever since I entered JC because I wanted to be a brand new person and try to be as happy as I can be, but it's only been working out for the past month. My old anxieties of 'what if I offend this person' 'what if I say the wrong stuff' 'are they talking about me behind my back' 'did I say something wrong, why are they ignoring me (not on purpose, maybe I spoke too softly)' and these thoughts just fill up my mind and I slowly start to become more quiet and everyone notices it (because I'm quite loud and rambunctious in class and among friends) and ask me what's wrong and all, and I just shrug it off and smile again and everything's well again, so it seems.


These toxic thoughts keep filling up in my head recently and I don't know why. It's not like I've offended anyone (so I thought) but I keep getting the feeling that most people in class are sick of my cheery attitude in class and trying my best to answer questions in lectures and tutorials and it's really been hampering how I behave in class. And I want it to stop, but I don't know how to.

I'm really scared to voice it out to my friends because I don't want them judging me and thinking that I put on an act of being cheery and loud because that's who I want to be in class, that's who I want to be in order to feel happy. I'm hiding secrets, such as my sexuality, to them because I'm afraid that they might be homophobic (they often use 'gay' as like a funny term to describe a person's behaviour, and I don't really like it but I didn't ask them to stop either, and I just feel so shitty inside like I'm letting all of my fellow gays down) There're things that I don't fully agree with them either and sometimes I let them be known and I just feel like it's negatively impacting my friendships with them. 

There's a lot on my mind now, but it's midnight, so I can express only these thoughts coherently now. Thanks for reading it all, if you made it down here, and it's my first Reddit post that isn't a comment or reply to something haha. Good night! 

P.S. if you can give me some advice about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Thank you! And if not, thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqn8bg/jc_rant_about_somethings_thats_been_on_my_mind/,15,"[""I feel that the first step in forging new friendships is to be *authentic* and *sincere*, so as to let others know who you are. (not trying to say that you should share your personal stuff to new friends, as that's too early) Based on my various experiences, a real and lasting friendship is one where you can be comfortable in, talk and do whatever on your mind (as long as it's not illegal or harmful to anyone) and do not fear any judgement from your friends. (they accept you for who you are, vice versa) It's normal to overthink at times (I do that sometimes as well) but what you think may actually differ from what others think, so always remind yourself to avoid jumping into conclusions or you can engage them and find out what they feel/think, etc. (if needed) A piece of important advice is to have effective mutual communication so as to understand each other better and this will prevent any misunderstandings from occurring. Lastly, just be *yourself* and those who like you will stay and those who don't can just leave! (it's impossible to befriend everyone in life)"", 'i feel like sometimes, real friendship is also based off vulnerability; maybe you find people that u can trust? and i think it‚Äôll be better to talk to them, for they‚Äôll trust you if you trust them.', ""Ahhhh im not an expert on this but just wanna let you know that I've been at that point as well. The part where you shared about how you are afraid of offending others hits me. Maybe its just human nature to chase after transient glitters.\n\nAnyways, I feel like many times when we are going through such things, we often skew our sense of perception because people who feel they are unable to forge genuine bonds tend to seek it even more. What I am trying to say is, the way you feel they felt might not necessarily be true or rational.\n\nWith that said, should it be true, I think sometimes its good to self-check. Personally, I have noticed that people who are irksome are not those who ask questions in class, but those who gives off an air of superiority. I think if you love answering and asking questions, you are most probably under greater scrutiny, but I think you should deal with this not by shying away, but by being more aware and perceptive of the kind of vibe ure giving off either unconsciously or intentionally. Anyways, one way to get rid of this is to just actively help others or give others a chance to answer. I tend to only answer my tutor's questions when its left hanging or unable to be answered or when Im super excited and a fair portion are sharing their opinion, GP.\n\nHmm as much as I would like to share how the best bonds I have forged are through moulded or shared interests, I understand this is super hard for JC because theres only 20 people in each class. Also, I wont give the advice of how genuity and authenticity moulds friendship because, it don't. For example, if I have a bad-temper and I chose to be genuine and honest about it, sorry, it just doesnt work.\n\nBut with that said, I think that line has some truth in it in the sense that friendships are not formed by being overly intentional and it should feel fluid and un-staged. I guess at this point, its finding that one person in the group that shares similar interests and thoughts. You would often realise how many are also just trying to fit in while laughing at the 'gay' joke. Maybe by not laughing at it (which i always TRY not to), people would find you authentic and seek solace in your presence. Ever since JC, as much as I have made a fair bit of offensive jokes, I have rarely laughed or joined in jokes that I don't believe in, even if it is funny. \n\nFor example, in NS, I had a few buddies who do get bullied, but I have never joined in to laugh at them or mock them deliberately and I would love to think that that established my boundaries. The only time I find it alright and fun to mock them is when I know they are in it too. That actually helped me to forge deeper connections with my platoon mates and even among those who gets bullied."", 'agree with the many comments. awkwardly it isn\'t that everyone will like you for you/who you are in life. awkwardly i never had numerous of great/true/genuine friends in school life other than possibly ite period but outside sch, work/tuition/enrichment/kpop/cpop/game i do have countless of friends whom i can call friends truly(there for you/wouldn\'t judge you over every matter) etc. i\'ve always wondered if im the problem what not when i was schooling/younger. but humans are superficial, insecure, inferior issues. aka you can\'t ""please"" everyone & that was never solely ""one\'s"" issues what not.  \n\n1 always just ensure if everything is mutual if it works/doesn\'t work. like you can make efforts to make things work but if the other party really just isn\'t keen then forget it really. you know it takes 2 hands to clap in all relationships.  \n2 i def do agree being yourself/outspoken isn\'t that norm in my days. unsure about now. eg ""everyone likes a/b/c but you like d/e/f hence you are always being the odd one out etc"" / you have a mind of your own for opinions/aren\'t easily wavered by others to fit to the norm etc.  \n3 so long you did not hurt anyone\'s feelings / be it intentional or unintentional nor ofc not harm anyone physically or etc.. there isn\'t anything wrong. a great number of people are not self aware/even as you grow older/start working/adapting to adulting etc. ; so long you are aware/responsible/accountable of what you are doing.  \n\nthen generally i guess you are fine. society does make people introverts too : D üòÖ', 'i feel that as long as you‚Äôre being you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. bc tbh no one has the right to tell you what‚Äôs right or wrong. everyone‚Äôs different and unique in their own ways. if they start calling you names, just ignore them bc it‚Äôs not worth it getting sad over these people bc they‚Äôre not going to matter much in your life anyways. start finding a group of friends that you‚Äôre comfortable with and you don‚Äôt have to please everybody bc it‚Äôs not your job too. jus continue being you and know that you‚Äôre amazing just the way you are and don‚Äôt ever let anyone else tell you otherwise! ‚ô•Ô∏è', ""I totally get the last part especially; I've lost so many people by just being who I am; last time I had a great genuine friendship was when I was in primary school oop\n\nI'm just scared of losing them, I guess. That's my worst fear, because if I lose them, then I will have to suffer being alone again for another 2 years. I don't think I am mentally and emotionally strong enough to handle it again if I lose more friends when I speak my thoughts out 100%, so I try to think through things before I speak out often, in fear of offending them. It's so hard with that too, cause people don't usually tell you to your face when you offend them, so whenever there's a slightly negative change to my friend's behaviour towards me (like maybe ignoring me a little), my brain just jumps to the conclusion that I've offended her someway. And then I try to track back with our convos and try to find out what was it that I said that could have offended her. And that makes me second-guess the whole convo and I'm so tired of doing that. I wish I could try to care less of what everyone thinks of me, I really try to act like I'm insensitive to what my friends are potentially talking about me, but sometimes (like now) it fails and I spiral down a self-hate hole. \n\nI did try my best to be like who I am and want to be by being outgoing (because that's how I am with people close to me) and it was generally well-received. So I technically have no reason to be self-hating and overthinking things right now, but it still happens.

In JC i was motivated to study and get to know my peers. However,they were exclusive. What shocked me is the fact that they created a group without a bunch of us to cyber bully us and mock us( i wont go into details) 

At first i was rlly shocked and affected by it. I went to school everyday thinking about their hurtful comments and i felt vengeful. They even laughed at us openly.  

I dreaded lessons. I rlly wanted to study and do well but the thought of them being there rlly made it hard to concentrate without those hurtful remarks circulating in my mind. 

What rlly kept me going is the thought that this experience will come to an end eventually. 2 years or 3 years will pass by sooner than you think.

[Uni] US COLLEGE ADVICE,University :snoo_smile:,1585396802.0,"Long post ahead as I‚Äôm going to give some background.

I took my O-Levels in 2015 and got a nett L1R5 of 8. I could have gone to a JC, but I went to a Polytechnic instead as I prefer more hands-on learning. Back in Secondary school I knew I wanted to be a doctor one day even though I did not fully understand what it meant to be one.

I then graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with the Diploma of Biomedical Science with a cGPA of 3.429 out of 4. My GPA in year 1 was 3.3 and 2.8 because of a break-up which I regret getting affected by. In year 2 I decided to study harder and achieved a 3.4 and 3.7. At that point in year 2, I also started to receive more exposure to the healthcare industry and started to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a doctor. In year 3 I worked my ass off and got a 3.9 and 4. While I was in Polytechnic I participated actively in Clubs and Societies and organised multiple activities. After graduating, I also shadowed doctors to further my experience.

I‚Äôm now serving my NS as a Commando Medic and am now even more motivated to be a doctor. I‚Äôll not explain my personal motivation on Reddit, but I have a lot of passion for Medicine and it‚Äôs a career I really wish to pursue. As all of you on here probably know, 3.429 won‚Äôt really get me anywhere close to Medicine locally, even applying through the discretionary pathway will not help. 

I‚Äôve decided that perhaps pursuing Postgraduate Medicine is a better option. I‚Äôve gotten offers for Biomedical Science from several Australian GO8 Universities I applied to. Because I did Biomedical Science in SP, I received advanced standing and am able to complete a BSc in Australia in 1.5 to 2 years. Which means that if I decide to study in Australia I will be able to attain an MD within 6 years (I‚Äôll be 28). 

I used to think that perhaps getting an MD as fast as possible would be the better option, but I now have a different mindset. I would love to be exposed to as many things as I can during my Undergraduate years and do not mind studying 4 years Undergrad + 4 years Postgrad. I‚Äôve applied to YNC and am on the Waitlist. Hopefully they do offer me or I will apply again.

I‚Äôve decided to apply to US colleges as well as I do not want to limit my options. Any idea of my chances with these colleges? I‚Äôm interested in John Hopkins/UCLA/UC Berkley/UCSD/NYU/UWash/Gerogetown.

"[A Levels] sad and lonely, how to not dread school?",Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585393463.0,"hi! i'm really so sorry to rant here but i've been dreading to go to school and i really really hate it... i cry at the thought of having to go to school almost everyday. i feel overwhelmed by some things and this is going to be really long so feel free to read if you don't mind because i just need somewhere to vent :( i feel tired, not motivated, sad, lonely and many other negative feelings on a daily basis and it's really draining me out. my life really feels like a mess

i've been feeling this way for a few months, i think since prelims started in august. i have always felt lonely since then because that was when everyone started mugging hardcore for o levels. i didn't do well for prelim, i got 41 points and i accepted that because i was always at the bottom of the cohort and did nothing to improve until the end. i knew it was my fault and i was struggling the entire time. especially during that study break between prelims and o level, i was going for hours of consultations and staying in school from morning to evening to study on my own. some days i had one classmate who was there with me and i'm really grateful for her and i don't blame my friends for not wanting to study with me because i would have slowed them down though but i really couldn't help but to feel so lonely :(

o levels itself was difficult for me too, everyday i was wondering whether i'll even be able to go anywhere and was coming back home crying after every period. it was a difficult period and i was really excited for o level to end and have fun and all

but two weeks after Os ended, my family was supposed to go overseas for a holiday that we have been planning for since june and i was really looking forward to it but my grandma died the day before we were supposed to fly :( she died from stroke alone at her house. when i saw her, all i saw was a cold dead body and blood and it was so traumatizing. i'm still crying over her death and i feel so miserable but i dont know how to be okay again

the rest of the holidays passed by blurry i dont really remember anything, i was just at home and sad. results day came by and i was happy because i managed to go from passing 2/6 subjs to 5/6 subjs, which was enough for me. managed to join MI and was looking forward to it for a fresh start...

but i dont know. i really dont regret going there, i got into a cca i liked, i met some really nice people but im so exhausted and tired... like i said i'm really dreading to go to sch... i'm the only person in my sch who went there. the daily commute from one of the estates in the east to bukit batok is really really tiring and i just want to stopüò≠üò≠üò≠ i just want to give upüò≠ also after a month of school i moved to a new house. we moved to take care of grandma because she had dementia and some other health issues but she died before we could move and our new house is so near to her house (i can see her block when i look out of my house) and it makes me feel so sad everyday... :( it doesnt help that i still do not have a friend group and i dont really have anyone that i can talk about more personal stuff too... all my close friends from sec sch went to the same few jcs in the east and theyre all so happy and it hurts everytime i open ig and see them all together

i feel like i've lost interest in everything i hate everything that i used to like in sec sch like mt lessons pe lessons and recess because i dont have friends. everytime after lessons i just sit in the library and either cry or tear up because i thought of how i've never felt this way before in sec sch and i felt so sad... i miss my friends and i feel so lonely... i know its kind of my fault that i dont have friends because i somewhat isolate myself... talking to people has became so tiring and i find it so damn difficult to make friends with anyone... :( its so tiring i talk to someone for awhile then i have no energy anymore and i just give up. now during recess i choose not to eat too because i dont know i would just rather go lib

i dont know guys thank you if you've read until here i just really feel so horrible i've been crying everyday its so hard to adapt and cope and accept my fact that my grandma is dead and that i have a new school and new house and no friends and all these changes are so overwhelming for me. im so tired and i want to just not bother about anything but i chosw to do a levels to prove myself wrong that im not useless worthless hopeless like i think i am but at this point of time im really just really so close to giving up

tldr ; dread gg to sch, sad and lonely, no friends, new sch is alm 2 hours away from home, just moved to new house, grandma died, miserable all the time

edit ; i forgot to add but ive been going for school counselling for almost a month but recently my counsellor said that she suspects i have depression and would like to refer me to external parties. thing is, i'm scared because i have my own doubts and if i do get referred outside, def my parents have to know. im not sure if they really understand what depression is. honestly, i just want to talk to someone who can relate or understand how i feel like now, or someone who can share with me how seeking help for depression is like :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqi47p/a_levels_sad_and_lonely_how_to_not_dread_school/,130,"['Wah, i would have chosen poly route if I were you.

In fact, it creates even more stress and anxiety which dampens performance. \n\nWhat i suggest you should do is to form study groups or consult teachers/counsellors.

I don‚Äôt think you dreading school is a main issue right now; the main issue should be helping you feel relieve from all the distress that you‚Äôre having. I would suggest to find the courage and strength in you to book a session with the school counsellor to talk out your issues. Or you can always go for the free mental health services at CHAT if you don‚Äôt want the school to be involved. Mental health issues can affect anyone, it doesn‚Äôt discriminate.

It was probably the change from poly to JC that was very stressful so I turned to SH to cope with it. I developed social anxiety and just wanted to hide, and basically had just...really negative thoughts about life. \n\nI'm glad you're seeing the school counselor. That's a good step. I did the same and was initially scared to tell my parents about what I was going through. I didn't want to be more of a burden I guess. And I felt like my worries didn't matter so I bottled everything up. But as my behaviours escalated, I knew I needed help because it was affecting my life and relationships. \n\nSo don't be afraid of seeking professional help. Don't be afraid to tell your parents. I am very fortunate in that my parents and siblings became my pillars of support. I don't have friends that know about my disorders...so it's just my family. Please reach out to them asap so that they can help you.\n\nHere to talk whenever. Also, jiayou for your studies!!"", 'hey. as someone who went through the medical system for mental health, one thing I would like to point out is to not expect much, if at all, to help. You might get antidepressants, but for most people it does nothing but make your poop cycles rather messed up. \n\none thing I liked to as myself is this:\n\nam I depressed because of some chemical imbalance in my brain which dulls hormonal response in such a way that my limbic system thinks my life is more shit than it actually is , or is my life itself actually shit and anyone in my shoes will think the same?\n\nI figure that antidepressants might help with the former, but I conclude that it didn\'t help me because I was in latter camp. neither did counselling, because no matter how I tried to frame my life and change my perspective, I could never change my life itself from counselling, and I would venture that most people if they had gone through what I did they wouldn\'t be happy either. So didn\'t talking to my parents help, because I got a nice slap for daring to consider killing myself as a possible alternative.\n\nI suppose you were very close to your grandmother. this was very much the case for me, and I know for sure that I will never be able to let go of this grief unless dementia takes over me as well when I am older. One thing that I like to tell myself is that I wouldn\'t grief my grandmother in the first place if she was a piece of shit who abused me, and it is precisely because she was such a kind gentle soul who took tireless care of me when I was a spoiled brat that  I would grief her. So in a way this grief is the price to pay for a loving childhood, and while I would rather not pay the price in the first place, I cannot deny that my memories of my grandmother are truly my dearest and without them I would have already been a splatter of meat under my flat a long time ago. And I guess I am not going to change much, because I have fully accepted that my life is mostly a pile of shit with some nice bits which I have let slip past without appreciating them enough. All that is left is most likely going to be shit. No amount of counselling and anti depressants can repackage that shit into something nice. No way is a ""cheer up"" doing jack. But what I can do is try to make it less shit. It is still going to be shit, but at the end of the day if I am going to be forced to eat shit anyway, I would rather choose to eat less shit than more shit.\n\nhope this helps. I am open for a chat too.', 'im not good at advices so i wont give one but i read through the whole thing and even though its not relevant, just want to say you did great going from passing a few subjects to 5/6 subjects. its really not easy and i wish you all the best is crossing over this hurdle as well, jiayou!', ""Hi, hope i don't appear as rude ):. Grief is normal, and from your post, it seems as if this is totally justifiable, but i think if it gets very debilitating and makes you a low-functioning person, I would suggest to book an appointment with either the School Counsellor or a Clinical one. Grief is complicated and people expresses it in different ways. Seek your friends for support, and not for reliance. As much as many of them would love to think, none of them are equipped to deal with these emotions and worse, it might cause a strain between your friendships. Seek an expert on it, talk about it, and if it works, thats great, if it doesn't there are still many outlets. Depression tends to skew your sense of perception and perspective, know that the negative emotions you experience might be irrational and unfunded, I hope that gives you some sense of relief. If you need some support, I am here :). \n\nTldr; friends are not equipped with skills to deal with complex emotions, DONT rely on them.

[JC] recommendations for laptop in jc?,A Levels :snoo:,1585362442.0,"i‚Äôve only found laptop recommendations for uni / poly and barely for jc hence im asking here

the reason im thinking of purchasing a laptop is due to the covid-19 home based learning. my entire household has only one computer, and i have to share it with my siblings. my school has offered me to go back to school to access their laptops but i live so far from school that i think i‚Äôll have higher chance of getting the virus lmao, considering i live near a cluster and my sch is also near a cluster. plus its a waste of 2 hours where i could have been doing hw at home

plus i have many online assignments and its super hard to do them on my phone xD

The lack of trackpad is also extremely irritating for me, especially in documents and slides.

Not sure about the price now. \n\nAgain, if you have any other questions, you can pm me!"", ""I'm using the Acer Swift 5 and maybe I can give my 2 cents worth. \n\nFirst off, it's definitely worth the price. it's less than a kilo, which still surprises me when I lift it up with just 2 fingers. Its got decent battery life, around 8 hours, but it gets dangerously low towards a school day for me, around 12-15% normally. Its definitely a 3/4 day battery life tho and you will need to charge it every day. \n\nPerformance-wise, I wish I took the RAM upgrade cause I really feel the RAM limitation while having 30+ chrome tabs open cause of research for school projects or while editing photos and videos (which I do as a hobby).  The 8th Gen i7 8565 version I have is more than enough for my use case, which I have mentioned above. There is no GPU, which I sometimes wish I had due to the extra power it would give my edits, but apart from that, I don't game much on my laptop so I don't usually feel the need for one. Again, your mileage may vary based on what you want to use your laptop for. \n\nThe screen is a solid B+. It is definitely sharp and very nice to look at, which the only downside being the color accuracy and colorspace coverage being quite average at best. (This only matters if you want to edit photos and videos on your laptop. For normal watching videos and looking at photos and scrolling the internet, it doesn't matter at all.) The biggest flaw this screen has is that it is not too bright, so it gets somewhat hard to look at when in strong, direct sunlight. \n\nFor the trackpad and keyboard, they are pretty good. Nice to type on and the trackpad is nice and smooth to use. It is pretty small though, and I wish it was bigger (I come from the nice and big trackpad of the 2016 HP Spectre x360). \n\nOverall, I would recommend it if you can fit it in your budget. Also, it is extremely drop resistant. Dropped it a couple of times and its all well and good, despite a couple of paint chips. The blue is extremely sexy IMO, and not much of a fingerprint magnet either. \n\nHMU if you have any other questions. I'll do my best to help you out."", 'The typing experience is personal preference. Personally, from the albeit limited use I have from a friends folio, I really dont like the short key travel and the overall feel of typing on it, even if it is for a short period. I guess you will eventually get used to it over time, but its not for me. Bringing a separate keyboard that is not the integrated keyboard-case negates the advantage of the lightness of the iPad Pro anyways IMO. \n\nThe mouse/track pad support again comes with the additional disadvantage of having to bring a mouse along with you and the iPad and your keyboard. That is not usually an issue with most laptops as the trackpad is usually sufficient. \n\nYour point of using the web version of the docs via safari is definitely valid and not something I thought of nor what the majority of my iPad using friends do, so that is a valid solution to the problem.', 'yep the keyboard folio is a pretty poor typing experience when compared to laptops but it does offer the best portability+utility ratio. \n\nAnyway the new magic keyboard for the ipad pro would solve the typing+trackpad problem but it‚Äôll probably lead to another problem of $$$\n\nPersonally, the benefits of the iPad Pro as a tablet (notetaking, media consumption) outweigh any downsides it has as a ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù but ultimately it is down to the individual‚Äôs usecase', 'Yeap $350 USD (or about $500 SGD) for the keyboard is a bit much ON TOP OF THE $999 USD (or about $1500 SGD) FOR THE BASE MODEL iPAD PRO. (No, Im not shouting, Im just on mobile and idk how to bold. If anyone knows how to lmk.) Now, the whole point of using an iPad is the note taking advantage. So you need the Apple Pencil too. Thats $120 USD (or about $171 SGD). Thats effectively a $2170 SGD laptop MINIMUM. Also, IMO 128 GB is not enough. It just isnt. I find myself needing at least 512 GB for all my schoowork for the last 3 years. So a 512 GB iPad Pro is $1300 USD (or about $2000 SGD) The best part is that you need to pay $150 USD (or about $215 SGD) extra for the priveledge of a cellular connection. That brings the effective price for a reasonable iPad Pro set up to be $2670 SGD, not taking into account the extra price of a cellular connection and assuming that you are happy being limited to just Wi-fi. You may as well get a solid top end, fully specced out Dell XPS 15 at that point, or heck even a MacBook Pro 13 inch if you wanna stick with the apple route. \n\nEdit: Anyone is free to double check my maths. All the prices are accurate from the apple store online (USA) as of 12.40 am on 19/03/2020 with the conversions to SGD being done at the same time. The prices may vary on the SG website, as well as any education bundles that Apple SG may have that may give any discounts, but really thats not gonna knock off much. Just a couple of hundred bucks max, and only on the iPad too.

[A Levels] How to score for chem,A Levels :snoo:,1585356995.0,"Suddenly thought of this because I saw an Alevel post on my feed lol. Context: Am senior who scored DESU (mostly s/u) for chem all the way until prelims B, Alevels A. Hated chem. This is how I achieved the big jump in grades:

For organic chem, how I went from not understanding anything at all to being pretty confident was DOING TOPICAL DRILL PRACTICES. At first I tried to memorise all the reactions by flipping textbook again n again, trust me doesnt work. What u can do is: Flip textbook a few times, make ur notes if u want, but after that, go buy some TOPICAL drill practice OChem assessment book (or ask frm ur teacher) and just do all of the questions for each topic. (make sure the assessment book has answers btw) (also make sure each topical practice has a lot alot alot of questions like 50 questions if not this method might not work if u have bad memory like me)

For the first few questions, its ok if u dk how to do, just refer to the answer and make a mental note in ur mind relating the question to the answer. As u keep doing repetitive questions, you will naturally memorise the reaction. This is how u build a foundation of knowing all the reactions/characteristics etc. Also MAKE SURE ur assessment book questions are really the very very basic memorisation without critical thinking kind because if ur like me u would be starting from next to zero knowledge when doing each topical practice, the point is to build up ur memory of reactions not to test ur critical thinking. Also consult ur chers if needed!

Btw the above is for OCHEM ONLY. For physical chem, u really need to read textbook and UNDERSTAND what is going on, not just memorise the answer structure n anyhow plug in values for different questions. After understanding, u can go ahead and do practice questions too (although I would say for phys chem doing alottt of basic drill practices is not that important, just UNDERSTAND concepts and do tutorials.) 

And ofc do TYS also! Trust me please guys because I really sucked at chem and this method worked really well. Jiayou for A Levels!

Edit: Also if your schools‚Äô lecture notes are super wordy and have unnecessary info like mine, just learn the stuff listed in the learning objectives! Don‚Äôt be like me and ignore it and end up memorising unnecessary shit (in J1 before i discovered it existed)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqa1lc/a_levels_how_to_score_for_chem/,114,"['Some good stuff here, just to add on: \n\n1) Organic chem is not simply, and simply not, meant to be memorized. It\'s also all about subtle nuances, as demonstrated in the sentence before this one. With regards to reactions, seek first to understand, and then to memorize. The things you should really memorize first, though, are electronegativities of atoms, and exactly how a bond is polarized (e.g. C=O, C-Cl), etc. Knowledge of Atomic Structure and Chemical Bonding are integral to understanding of org chem. There\'s a reason why those topics are taught first; ergo, if you don\'t already understand those topics really well, go revise them before attempting org chem. \n\n2) Understanding entails asking ""Why?"". ***You have nothing to lose by gaining a bit more understanding that will help ground your understanding of a concept and hence internalize it.*** You have, however, everything to lose if you just blindly memorize concepts without understanding only to be thrown off by some novel reaction in the A-levels which tests conceptual understanding rather than conceptual knowledge. Case in point: those who don\'t actually understand nucleophilic substitution reactions fail to realize how intramolecular SN2s (or SN1s) work; those who don\'t realize how NaBH4 and LiAlH4 are actually sources of hydride nucleophiles are stunned when they come across contexts which allude to this property. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for physical chem: \n\n* Contrary to OP\'s post, doing basic drill practices IS important and should **not** be skipped or otherwise glossed over in favour of doing more complicated questions. I hope OP was not implying otherwise. Doing basic drills only becomes important once you master the skills involved to the extent that you can read a solution for a higher-order question and not have trouble with the rudiments. Some still make the careless mistake of (2x)\\^2 = 2x\\^2 when performing stoichiometric calculations, and this is attributable to a lack of basic drilling. \n* Everything else OP says applies \n\nPractice doesn\'t make perfect; practice makes permanent', 'Which topical drill assessment book did you purchase? :D', 'practice', 'do you have any tips on memorising the reactions in the periodic chapters and TM?', 'lol are you from hc? cuz yes, the notes are really unnecessarily wordy, so much irrelevant content that simply the thought of flipping through is discouraging enough to make me procrastinate for chem :""(', '^^ Understanding also helps you remember the info better!', 'Actually im not sure cuz its my cher print for me one.

For me I let my teacher mark all the practices I did and go through during consult instead of using answer key cuz ans key sometimes not accurate/too wordy.', 'Honestly I cant remember but I think making notes that only contain the stuff in the learning objectives for periodicity n TM helps a lot because it cuts out all the unnecessary stuff in the lecture notes (if ur lecture notes are like my schools with a lot of unnecessary info).

[poly] scared and worried about school,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585343622.0,"Idk these few days I have a sudden fear of poly :/

First of all, I m afraid that I might not make friends in my course and cca. The virus outbreak have cancelled all the orientations and cca fiesta and honestly it sucks and I m afraid that I might not make friends or even see the environment of the cca and school to prepare myself mentally :P

Secondly, I m afraid about joining new ccas. This time I m planning to join totally new ccas like being in student ambassadors. I m a total introvert that freaks out when talking to a bunch of people HAHA and joining that will be totally out of my comfort zone. But the main reason why I wanted to join is because I want to build up my confidence and want to try new things and discover new things about myself. However, the worry doesn‚Äôt goes away, and I fear that I would be awkward there and don‚Äôt fit in (IF I even managed to pass the interviews buhh) 

Lastly, i m mostly afraid that I might not do well in poly zzz. Tbh Idk I m even fit for this course, and worry I might not understand the modules and did badly for the tests & exams :P I also worry about projects works, that I would meet sucky grp mates and pull down my GPA but I know i can‚Äôt totally avoid meeting then so I need to learn manage the situation

[A Levels] How to do well for PW - from a senior,A Levels :snoo:,1585323034.0,"Hi guys I'm back, and today I want to give some PW advice to the J1s! It's been 2 years already, but I'll try to recall my experience as much as possible and give you guys some tips! As usual, this is not a foolproof guide to scoring A for PW, so take my words with a pinch of salt!

First, CREATE RAPPORT with your groupmates. For me, I was pretty lucky to have a few outgoing groupmates, since I am quite shy and reserved myself, so my groupmates helped to ""set the tone"" for the next few months together. I can't stress how important it is to have an amicable working relationship with your groupmates. When you guys have 1 disagreement, please please please settle it ASAP and don't sweep it under the rug. Cause when more disagreements arise, there will surely be beef eventually. Let me tell you, other groups will love listening to your group beef. And when other groups know about it, you will rant even more to them and become even more unhappy, when you could have solved the problem when it first arised! One way to build a good working relationship if you guys don't already have one, is to have lunch or dinner outside together. Try not to discuss about PW during lunch/dinner, but talk about other things. Learn more about each other and their personalities. That will help you greatly in the future. This helps yall bond, and when you guys are bonded and there are disagreements in the future, yall will automatically solve it amicably. 

Next, LISTEN TO YOUR PW TUTOR! At first, my tutor kept nitpicking at my group's ideas and we had to keep changing our topic. I think my group can't think of good ideas so eventually our tutor helped us with the brainstorming process as well. My tutor was so nitpicky and his comments were sometimes harsh, my group eventually became quite demoralised and it reached the point where whenever our tutor called our group, we would be like ""oh no now what"". But guess what! My whole class got A for PW and I highly believe it's because of our PW tutor. So whenever your tutor comments on your ideas, keep an open mind. Don't complain. Think about it this way: ""If my tutor did not tell us about this problem, maybe we will get B for PW"". Tutors want you to get A. That's why they can be quite naggy sometimes. Instead, be grateful to your tutor for taking the time to slowly look at your reports and find all the mistakes. Then when your tutor finally praises you, I tell you yall will feel damn good inside. 

Next, DO THE WORK IF YOU HAVE TO. For sure there will be slackers. And some of them will never change. But this concerns your final A-Level grade. So don't take the chance. If they don't change, don't waste time ranting about them to other people. Instead, do the quality work yourself. I know some people will disagree with me on this, and alot of people will ask you to tell your tutor. Yes, tell your tutor if you have to. But sometimes it still doesn't work. So tank the project if you have to. As I said in my previous post on how to do well for As, I believe in Karma. We all get what we deserve according to how much effort we put in at the end of the day. 

Lastly, ok this one is not really a tip though... So i'm sure 99.9% of you guys are thinking about how useless PW is. That was me I felt that PW was the most useless thing ever. But right, to be honest, I lowkey feel that actually PW was quite useful hahaha. The skills you get from PW are actually damn valuable. In fact, I'm actually using my OP skills I learnt from PW for my Uni and scholarship interviews now. The eye contact, the hand gestures, the natural speech, all that I developed from PW and applying in interviews now. So PW is not that useless after all.


Ok thats about it. All the best for PW guys!

[Uni] Am I crazy for not wanting to go uni?,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1585320290.0,"It‚Äôs quite suffocating, I want to get this off my chest.

So what do I want to do? The truth is, idk.

Yeah, I didn‚Äôt do well for As (68RP). I‚Äôm thinking of retaking As/take a gap year while still working to buy some time of what I really want to do in life, but literally everyone advises against it.

Honestly, I dread going to uni. I applied to NUS and NTU but I doubt if I can enter with my low RP. And then again, I‚Äôm not too sure about the courses that I applied to. What do I really want to do in the future?

Right now, I‚Äôm currently working part-time and I enjoy my job. I look forward to going to work (didn‚Äôt felt this when in JC.) Truthfully, I would rather work than study now. My friend said I could be addicted to work from seeing the money roll in. Maybe because after 2 years in JC, I‚Äôm finally seeing the fruits of my labor. In a way, I felt worthy.

There are pros and cons, but some jobs would subsidise the fees for their employees if they are taking on additional courses related to their specialised work. Hence, they get to save $, while also improving their profile.', 'Of course not, perfectly fine to think this way as you may find joy in working instead of studying but you do have to realise that a degree would offer you more options and chances for social mobility; right now maybe it is still alright as you are young and can probably work in any type of job but in the long term, when you are old, it is possible you will encounter employers who are ageist and elitist and seeing that you not having a degree would perhaps turn them off from hiring. Maybe you would like to think about the future, when you are older and need to save up to pay off bills and buy a house etc, going to uni and getting a degree may be a good idea after all. Just my opinion but all the best :)', ""I think it's fine to work for now, a gap year can give you more perspective. On one hand joining uni now can give  you more 'security' bc it feels like your life is 'on track' as defined by society in general; on the other it sucks if you get into a course for which you have no interest (something I'm facing now even though I took a gap year haha).\n\nI have a couple of friends who worked part time after their A's because no uni accepted them, so they stopped trying. They are now doing a part time degree in local unis, which honestly is really quite worth it i think.\n\nThey have 2 years worth of working experience and cash, they can get their degrees in 2 years and of course, pay less because the course is shorter. So quite a financially sound decision imo because they will still be able to get decently paying jobs. \n\nIf you don't feel like attending uni but u apply for it anw and u don't like it you will just have to push through. If you take a gap year and work, its fine also just work hard and try to get into a uni later. A good work ethic and resilience is important."", 'Hello!

Just popped by to tell you that I‚Äôll be cheering you on whichever path you choose to tread!', ""some jobs require a degree e.g. doctor, others do not e.g. a Grab driver.  \n\n\nIn general, ppl with degrees earn more than those who do not.  \n\n\nYou can also study at SIT in the future; it is for adult learners, who eventually discover joy or necessity in studying.  \n\n\nUltimately, it's your life."", ""I may not have much experience in this area, but from what I've learnet from my personal life so far is: Irregrdless of what other around you may say or what kind of advice they may give, at yhe end of the day, they are only tring to help you/protect you by giving their best advice. So once you make up your mind about your course of action regarding uni or work, stick to it.\n\nTldr: You know yourself best.

It isn't easy going down an unconventional route but u still did it anyways. I feel like u will be able to reap many benefits by taking a gap year. Reason being is that not only u will have to be able to be independent, u will also gain some maturity and see how the society works at the same time. And through such experiences i feel that u will be more certain and ready to chase ur dreams and do well in uni. The point about uni is not about the degree u have but what u are able to offer to the table for ur employer. Since everyone has a degree, what makes u a more deserving candidate as compared to another applicant?

Initially I didn't want to pursue a degree cause I honestly dreaded studying and I also got rejected by the top 3 universities. When I tried to apply a full-time job with my diploma, it was really hard. Many of the companies want years of experience, or a min degree cert. Realistically, you can survive without a degree but you might not have that many job opportunities, and you'll have a lower starting pay. If you're unsure of what to do now, I'd recommend taking a gap year to try out different jobs, and be open to new experiences.

Would it be more advisable to pursue a more generic/common double degree in Business and Information Systems at SMU or pursue a more niche career such as ASD in SUTD? Personally, I‚Äôm interested in both subjects but I‚Äôm afraid about the career prospects if I decide to pursue ASD in SUTD. Additionally, I‚Äôve heard that Business and Information Systems would be a more lucrative career path than ASD, where salaries may be more polarised as junior architects/designers earn a hugely significant lesser amount than the senior architects. It‚Äôs also a more risky venture as design is subjective and I feel like ASD would be a lot of effort into a project that may not interest me? Also, I may not have much autonomy in terms of design in an ASD-related career.

However, for Business and Information Systems, I‚Äôm worried about the competitiveness of the industry as the Finance sector is inevitably one of the most competitive industries out there with many people better than you. So i‚Äôm really torn between these two career choices.

[Poly] Maintaining a gpa above 3.85,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585218889.0,"I‚Äôve been really set on going to jc because people told me it‚Äôs easier to get into Uni. However, looking at how difficult jc is and how many jc students have and are breaking down because of jc, I really don‚Äôt know if I should go there. 

I also heard going to poly provides one more time to build one‚Äôs portfolio. 

I hence wanna ask poly students what did you do to maintain a high GPA? How did you fare as compared to your o levels? Did you have as much time as you expected to build your portfolio and revise for your exams/finish your projects? Was it stressful for you because you felt that you need to ace ALL exams in poly?

Thanks for reading and I hope you have a nice day:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fp9b30/poly_maintaining_a_gpa_above_385/,15,"[""Graduated with a GPA of 3.80 which is slightly under what you are aiming for but here's what I gathered over my 3 years (I'm from a social science course, so some of tips might not relate to what you are gonna study) :\n\n1. **Consistency** \\- At some points when times are tough (e.g hell week, multiple deadlines in a week), never give up and keep giving your best. It is important for you to read the rubrics of your every assignment to make sure you are answering the question and fulfilling the A-grade of each rubric section.\n2. **Finding a good group to work with** \\- I cannot stress this enough, having like-minded individuals in a group can make group work so much easier. With a good group, an A for group presentations and projects are the norm and can help to relieve pressure, especially if you didn't get a good grade for your individual assignments. Find people who have the same aim as you (e.g aiming for 3.85>) and stick with them.\n3. **Review your lecture and tutorial notes weekly and pay attention in class** \\- Firstly, don't snooze in class or lose focus if not it'll make your revision much harder. By right, even without constant revision of your slides, just by listening in class would be sufficient for you to have good fundamentals in your modules which makes studying for tests/exams much easier. Don't get distracted by your classmates or friends and just focus in class. A few jokes or laughs is fine but make sure you are taking in information from your lecturer. Socialising can wait til after class.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't say it is extremely difficult to do well in poly, it's just up to the individual to see how much effort they want to put, and of course at the end your results would be the reflection of your effort you put in in the 3 years. For myself, I was heavily involved with my CCA as well as outside commitments but was still able to get into NUS/NTU so time management shouldn't be a problem. The content (for my course at least) is manageable even with a very packed schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike what you pointed out, Poly really does help you widen your horizons in terms of working with industry partners and having more specific and hands-on experiences which can be good for your portfolio. If I could rate the difficulty of Poly vs JC (I went to JC for a year) I would give poly a 5/10 while JC was a 8 or 9/10 in terms of academic rigour. Just make sure to study hard and play hard in Poly at the right time =) \n\nYou can always PM me if you need more advice/opinions."", 'I graduated with 4 from an engineering course. \n\nFirst,  know what you want. If you want to go to top uni courses like MED, Law, REP, GEP, DPP ETC. Unless you have a very strong portfolio accompanied with near perfect gpa it will be near impossible to get in. So, just go JC as Unis are very bias towards JC students with high RP. I had my fair share of rejections(regretted not building my portfolio as well). Many of my JC friends got offer scholarship without interviews.\n\n If you have a strong interest in certain subject or course and know you want to do in the future, then go for poly. Poly is a great place for people who knows their goal as they get to hone their skills and gain knowledge in their field earlier on. You will be able to learn relevant hard/soft skills and build a strong portfolio for your career. \n\nIf you want to just get into local Unis then I believe both JC or poly is fine depending on your style. If you are strong in your academics, like to cramp your head and let 1 exam determine your life then go to JC. If you are someone who is very disciplined and committed, then go for poly as poly is based on cumulative results. \n\nI took a longer route, if I can, I would go for JC. Either ways you have to put in a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get what you want. There is no easy way out.', 'imo, if u have these complete these things u can definitely obtain a ‚Äúgood‚Äù gpa. \n\n1. be in an engineering course (idk why i just feel eng courses r easier. it‚Äôs just my opinion)\n\n2. attend all ur lectures\n\n3. consult ur teachers\n\n4. put in the work and study (u gotta understand the content, not memorise)\n\n5. dont be complacent \n\nthere are honestly numerous factors so take my words with a grain of salt heh', 'Not necessarily must have a high gpa to enter Uni. Sure the likes of NUS/NTU/SMU, the degrees will be very competitive and higher gpa will be required.\n\nBut not everything rides on a high gpa üôÑ', 'Fully agree with point 2, working in a high achieving group in my last 2 years made the projects much easier, as compared to my projects in year 1.', 'Oh what are unis still biased towards jc students? I thought times have changed. \n\nBtw what is REP GEP DPP(lol)?\n\nHmm my ultimate goal is uni so you would recommend me to go jc? I heard that the nature of the jc curriculum  basically renders students unable to participate in outside activities, unless you‚Äôre the high flyers. My main concern in hence the portfolio building if i go jc.', 'just curious, why do you think engineering is easier?', 'I‚Äôve heard the media courses are the most difficult to score because of its objectivity while engineering courses have the most straightforward answers and constant mugging will get you a high GPA. Is this true?', 'Ohh they are double degree programme, Renaissance engineering(ntu) and global engineering(nus). Basically there is no chance for poly students to take DDP and even med, REP etc take in atmost 1 or 2 poly students every batch.  \n\nThink long term, do you have an idea of what career do you want ? If yes, are there any poly courses that are relevant that will help you achieve your goal? Let‚Äôs say if you took on a course and realized it‚Äôs not something that you want, then it will be very difficult to do well and even if you do well are you able to proceed to uni courses that are unrelated ? (E.g business to engineering). Courses are unique, certain courses in uni requires prerequisite from poly courses. So do your research well. I have seen many of my friends that went for something that they did not like and graduatedwith poor gpa. \n\nI can‚Äôt speak much for JC curriculum. \nIn terms poly curriculum, a lot of free time (subjected to courses) to chill, mingle with your friends and participate in your interest group, I believe that it is definitely plentiful. Depending on your course and timetable, you might not even need to attend school on some days. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, exams are easier than JC unless you take advance modules. Most of the poly students are required to take bridging modules when they go to uni. Normally, poly students suffer more in exam in uni. \n\nPoly is design to prepare you for work and you definitely have many opportunities to build your portfolio.

For A levels to be a breeze, you need to get your foundation solid.

Sometimes making sure you understand something is so much more important than blindly repeating doing practice questions without really understanding the method.\n\nI think at this point you should focus on getting your content down, not necessarily at the expense of sleep and social life (because those are important too!), and if you yourself know you're doing okay then don't care too much about what other people are doing.

Hi! Just a J1 taking advantage of the time now to ask this qn since everyone‚Äôs asking about uni :)
I‚Äôm currently doing science stream in jc. Coming to study sciences in jc really made me regret my decision and confirmed my passion for arts/humans, and I really want to make the switch when I enter uni.

Some context: I got A1s for all my humans subjects back in Sec sch, and A2/B3 for the rest of my subjects.

Though I‚Äôm doing a hybrid combi now(couldn‚Äôt let go of humans haha), the sciences are just taking a toll on me, and everything just hurts and makes me confirm my passion hahahaha :‚ÄôD

I know it‚Äôs still too early for me to think about this, but I‚Äôm very worried if being in science stream will truly put me at a disadvantage if I want to do arts in uni. Plus it‚Äôs too late to change stream and subjects now :( What were your experiences? Sorry if I sound dumb or ignorant

The thing is, taking a science stream would open more choices and you could still study humanities in uni but it would be difficult the other way round as many science courses require Math + Phy/Bio/Chem/Computing etc. while humanities courses do not have that many limitations. I encourage you to do well for your studies first and open up yourself to more options as you may have a change of heart and interest in the future, who knows? All the best!', 'Nah.

[UNI] Questions on RVRC,University :snoo_smile:,1585201777.0,"Hi, im matriculating this year and I want to know about how RVRC is like. If possible, do offer your thoughts on the following:

1. college activities (what are the events the college holds?)

2. Y1 RVRC mods (are they good/bad/worth it?)

3. interest groups (do they make up a huge portion of the college's image?)

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fp67pt/uni_questions_on_rvrc/,6,"[""Hey, I'm an RVRC Y1 student so here's MY take\n1. We have extensive college activities. Some of them got cancelled coz of covid, but mostly we have q a lot. Events such as interest group (equivalent of CCA) fiesta, some movie watching in lawn, night cycling, dinner and dance and much others. Most of the events that happen across RCs happen here too ofc. \n2. So Y1 RV mods are basically GEQ1917(Replaces NUS wide GEQ mod), WR1401 (0mcs, just a chill mod) and Es1601 (usually replaces a language mod requirement). WR is an exception, so let's handle that first. It's a v chill module, just go class and play around kind. Only need to attend lesson (1.5hr) and just submit a reflection at end of sem. Honestly it acts as a p decent destressor for me, and also we do a lot of fun stuff like Kinball, tchouk and even went the temple at haw par Villa this sem. You can miss a couple of lessons if your rly cmi, so isok. \nGEQ and ES on the other hand, are much more tedious. I would say they are harder than the NUS wide equivalents, but more fun than them in terms of content (this is personal POV, look at content and decide to yourself). Compared to UTown mods, I think they're lighter workload coz they're spread over an year. They do need more work than 4MCs, but it's still manageable. Worst case just S/U. GEQ SEM 2 is project based (slightly similar to pw, but u can actually get money and implement it so kinda fun?). One thing to note is that the modules have been evolving a lot over the years since they're still quite new, and after a lot of feedback in semester 1 for ES mod, they changed extensively to make it better IMO.\n3. IGs aren't overbearing, which is exactly why I like RV. have only joined a couple of them and rarely go for them (I have other commitments in faculty and stuff so). I use them more for recreation than anything else, and there's a huge variety to choose from (or form your own, rv is q flexible that way).\n\nHope that answers it, any other doubts just reply here!"", 'Sorry for the shityy formatting, on mobile']","[1585214291.0, 1585214313.0]","[4, 2]"

I'm not sure where I wanna go so if y'all could help me out it'll be great thankss,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fosdbo/o_levels_poly_or_jc/,6,"['Personally, I chose to go to JC because I still wasn‚Äôt sure of what I wanted to do. Also, I don‚Äôt really have many practical skills or interests. I also heard that there‚Äôs a lot of group work and presentations in poly which I didn‚Äôt really like. There‚Äôs also this sense of familiarity when you go to JC anyways because it‚Äôs pretty similar to the system in secondary school. How you study is mostly the same, as long as you‚Äôre consistent and ask questions you‚Äôll do fine. The biggest different academically was probably that there was more critical thinking and applying of ideas involved. As an arts student, I hardly had to regurgitate or memorize anything, it was mostly about understanding. It definitely helped that I loved and had an interest in all the subjects I took because I was more motivated to learn and find out more.\n\nEdit: Also, the idea of being more independent and having to worry about how I dressed stressed me out a lot at the time. I guess I wanted to be hand-held a little longerüòÖ And I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs a bad thing, I think it‚Äôs more a case of how you want to develop more as a person, what aspect you choose to focus on and the way you want to go about it! You can PM me if you have any more specific questions:)', 'Hello\n\nUsually you should look at course that may interest you. I think nw poly gt some test to see your profile suit what course. You can try it when you go for open hse. \n\nFor me I like technical stuff and realise that I have like network and pc stuff so I take up IT for my diploma. \n\nPoly do prepare you for work life. Poly life is like no uniform and also got modules to take. Each sem gt 6 module. You got projects and exam to take. You need to manage your work and deadline well. Sec sch your teacher will chase you but in poly they dun. Poly also strict on deadline too. \n\nYou can refer to the link below(I have posted poly exp) \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f39c38/poly_poly_life_and_gpa/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nIf you have any qns can pm me', 'Think of it this way: Will you do better if your grades are dependent on the final piece of exam paper OR do better consistently throughout your 3 years of poly education ? If you take a look at your grades and realise you do better on your final lap, then go to a JC and take Alevel. If not, join a poly and you might do pretty well in it! But firstly, have an interest in a course before considering poly route. \nI took Olevel last year and I have to say I‚Äôm an average student but when it came to the Olevel period, I was really stressed out as your grades depend on your performance for that piece of paper. What you do during the 2/3hrs for an exam will determine your grade for a certain subject. You‚Äôve worked hard for 4 years just to take the Olevel and nobody knows what will happen during the actual exam day(which might be a good thing if you do well miraculously, or do badly even though you did consistently well in sec sch).\nI personally prefer my stress load to be separated into different modules(which is why I fit poly better), rather than the stress on an exam paper. Do well for Olevel first ! ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'i chose jc instead of poly\n\nunlike many who chose jc bc they don‚Äôt know what they want to do specifically yet, i already have a course in mind. but sadly literally no poly offers it :‚Äù so i have to take As to apply for uni\n\nadditionally, im not rly a hands on person and people would say im a ‚Äòmugger‚Äô although i don‚Äôt study that much. hence i felt that jc would suit me better than poly :)', 'hello! \n\nafter experiencing O levels, I personally felt that I don‚Äôt want to waste another 2 years ‚Äúmugging away‚Äù. I felt that there was much more to life than just studying and I didn‚Äôt want to waste precious time JUST on studies. \n\nHence, I went to poly! I had more time to do the things I love (volunteering, music, etc) and I managed to have more time with my family as well. Not only did I do well in my studies (graduated with 3.99/4.0), but because I was constantly doing the things I love, I (unexpectedly) built a portfolio that looks really good on paper which helps me to get scholarships, enter top unis (better than our local unis), and many more. \n\nAnd I personally felt that I wouldn‚Äôt do well in JC because I can‚Äôt wrap my head around the concept of studying so hard for 1.5 years to have your next 4 years determined by one single examination - this concept stresses me out. But it really differs from people to people! \n\nif you‚Äôre the type of student who prefers to chiong last min and just do well for major examinations - then JC really will be more suitable for you. \n\nThe biggest misconception about poly is that ‚Äúit is easier than JC‚Äù. Poly requires you to be good at everything you study because everything affects your GPA. Once you screw up, your perfect GPA is gone. And you can‚Äôt choose to ‚Äúfocus‚Äù on certain subjects just like how you did in secondary school because you basically need to be an all rounder and be consistent. \n\nJCs and Polys are both tough - the most impt thing is finding the school that suits u best. I had friends who quit poly and went to JC because they really can‚Äôt do well in poly, and they did really well in JC! \n\nI recalled SP has a website which sorts of help u figure out which course is most suitable for you! You can try to find it. \n\nIf not, you can always do personality tests and see what kind of jobs suit your personality. From there, you can try to figure out what kind of course u should choose to pursue. \n\nThink about your interests then think about your strengths and weaknesses! hopefully, your strengths could compliment the course you‚Äôre interested in!

1) Are the MDTs tasks each similar to previous years or the tasks given vary to a large extent?

2) There are supposed to be Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI). This year, the interview section is 1 hour consisting of 2 stations. Is this the norm? or does the MMI contain more stations and longer duration in previous years?
Also, are there any group interviews conducted...? 

3) which component, interview or MDT has a greater weight in determining one's acceptance?

I have plenty of poly friends who ended up doing something completely different from what they have studied in poly either at work or in university. My point is that there are very very few successful examples of people who know exactly what they want to do for the rest of their lives at the young age of 17. If you have just started JC, there is possibly still the option of transferring to a poly within your same batch since poly starts later. Look around at the courses and see what piques your interests. Talk to some seniors to find out about their experiences. But I would caveat that if going to a university is your ultimate goal, JC is still the faster and easier route.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more important to think about the subjects you enjoy, and whether you see yourself making a living with the skills picked up from studying these subjects. \n\nIf you‚Äôre currently in the science stream and you dont find any joy in it, you could consider asking for a switch to the arts stream (if its too late to switch, you can consider dropping a science subject to a H1) and vice versa. \n\nGiven that you did well for O levels, youre clearly academically inclined, and perhaps it was easier to study hard for Os since the goal was simple ‚Äî to get into a good jc.

As one of the commenters mentioned elimination is one way to do it but for me what worked was being able to reflect on what I liked and what I was passionate about.

If you really think about it, you probably didn‚Äôt have a direction in life back in secondary school too and that actually didn‚Äôt trigger your feelings of being lost and stressed.

It‚Äôs perfectly normal to feel lost atm and ill also argue that it‚Äôs good that you are thinking about this atm rather than having this thoughts perhaps after A levels (or worse during Uni üò±üò±)\n\nExcellent thing about being in JC is that you have the chance to take part in competitions (robotics, business case studies etc. etc) Don‚Äôt narrow it down to the major CCAs JC has but instead, look into the various interest groups and see if anything sparks your interests. If they are affected by covid (which i think wouldn‚Äôt be the case cuz these discussions could be done online and wouldn‚Äôt impact such competitions severely), you can look at taster Uni courses that are provided in Coursera and see what seems to spark your interests. Hopefully, it can further narrow down your interests and start looking at other opportunities present both within School CCAs or elsewhere to further build on it. i do understand that it can get overwhelming with JC work But it‚Äôs not impossible!

In fact it is the same whenever u transit from one institution to the next. Your certs and grades from the previous institution is merely your entry ticket for the next one. \n\nSo I would say you shouldn‚Äôt set expectations for your current grades based on what you got for Os. It is really not related in anyway. The game plan for As is completely different from Os. Unlike Os where there was a teacher/ mentor to push you and chase you As is really a matter of depending on yourself and your initiative to get better grades. And such a huge transition can be stressful. \n\nYou want to clarify doubts; you have to fix appointments with your teachers after school and make sure your doubts are clarified \n\nYou want extra practise apart from the given material; you have to source for it from your seniors/ Teachers \n\nYou want to be able to reflect holistic performance in your SGC (Your graduation cert); you have to manage your time efficiently.\n\nThere really is a lot of you involved so it is not going to easy and it is okay to be stressed. It is very normal. There are two types of people; people like me who have in to the immense stress and are now having regrets or people who worked with others and found a way to manage their stress. (I really hope you would be the latter type m8...)\n\nTo manage your stress I would say firstly stick with your friends throughout the journey. It is tough and it is draining and the only way you can come out of it sane is through the support of your comrades aka your fitness. \nDon‚Äôt compare results. Really comparing results with one another just makes it more stressful. It made it really intolerable for me to see my friends scoring more marks than me cos I considered it a defeat. Each and every person is different in a positive manner and it helps to acknowledge that. By doing so you wouldn‚Äôt find it that bad when your friends score higher than you; Nor would you look down on people who score lower than you.\nEngage in some relaxing hobby. Yoga, Cycling, hitting the gym whatever that is out of the school hectic life just engage in it while you can during your free time. \nAnd lastly sleep more.

So apparently, I received my GPA and it has dropped. It is due to mainly my group projects and hundred percent it was my group project.

Moreover, there was an serious issue which I felt like not to work with them again. I had asked another guy in my class to have him in his group project. but he said he will stick to his original team There were so many issues and I was shocked when one of them marked me down. That was unnecessary because I asked the group when to meet them on the next day I came back. Everyone were like we meet one week before school reopens. Fking hell.  This was for Module A

Then for module B, I disagreed with the idea but it was too late and they did not even tell me what were they making. When I saw the prototype,my heart sank. It was something they would not accept.

Moreover, for module A, I was only told in study week and they did not even tell me. Fking hell man. I could have done even better.

What is even worse is that they keep mocking people/other groups for meeting up regularly. The fact is the other groups met up frequently to discuss and did much better.

[O Levels] JC DSA - my concerns and questions,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1585131043.0,"Hi, I‚Äôm a sixteen year old scholar from an ASEAN country who‚Äôs currently studying in Sec 4, and I‚Äôm hoping to apply for DSA to different JCs.

The thing is, before I came to Singapore, I had a lot of achievements in arts and academics. However, during my first year in SG (Sec 3), I did terribly in school. My L1R5 was always above 20, even in End Of Year exams. I had depression and anxiety and other mental health problems which also gave a lot of people an impression that I wasn‚Äôt a positive/willing learner. However, after getting more settled down in SG and learning from my mistakes last year, I believe I‚Äôm a much happier & better person now. I‚Äôve also gotten significantly improved results in CA1, and received a lot of positive comments from my guardian, Teachers and friends throughout the term.

However, when I decided to apply for DSA‚Äôs this year, my biggest concern was that I did not do well in Sec 3. I was so naive and pessimistic and did not sign myself up for any leadership positions/ extra curriculars such as SecExco. I really regret my attitude and choices last year, as they are now a huge disadvantage to me. 

So my questions are,

1. If I‚Äôm just a normal member of my CCA (I‚Äôm from choir), but my CCA has achieved distinction in SYF and performed in the Esplanade hall, is there a chance of me being accepted (or even shortlisted) for DSA? I cannot play the piano or any instrument, but I am confident about my singing and techniques.

2. Will my Sec 3 results have very negative affects on my impression? If I do really well in MYE this year, could I possibly have a chance at DSA?

3. Are my past achievements in my country applicable? (Will they look at these past achievements and take them into account?) 

I‚Äôm very insecure and anxious because all my friends who are applying for DSA are also extremely outstanding, and no scholar from my country has ever gotten into a JC through DSA.

Yale-NUS has a concurrent degree programme to multiple graduate schools, do you want to pursue graduate education (more easily)? How important is residential college life to you?

OP, if you don't have a strong inclination in terms of course content, you should definitely consider the pedagogical approaches, community lifestyle, and degree of flexibility you want from your uni education.\n\n*Pedagogical approaches* \\- not sure how SMU's seminars work. Yale-NUS uses small-group seminars and starts all students off with a Common Curriculum. The common curriculum is very broad and has the cool effect of provoking so many perspectives from texts that everyone in the College has read, and it's an interesting look at how we as a species try to understand and rationalize the world(s) around us. Things like communication and presentation skills are taught in the process of studying the Common Curriculum instead of taking the front seat. I like it, but it's not for eveyone.\n\n*Community lifestyle* \\- Yale-NUS is a small community. That actually makes the social atmosphere very intense - everyone recognizes everyone else; also, everyone living together makes campus very lively, but also has its own set of challenges. SMU isn't as large as, say, NUS, but when I visit SMU (as I often do to take studying breaks when I go to downtown), the vibe is very different and a lot larger than YNC. I'm not qualified to speak about SMU's community, but I'm sure they're different!\n\n*Degree of flexibility* \\- at Yale-NUS your major is only declared at the end of Year 2, and the common curriculum also serves as a period of exploration where you can figure out what you want. I came in a prospective computer science student but will now probably major in Urban Studies. If you have very, very strong feelings about wanting to take PLE, and specifically the PL in PLE, SMU might be a better option. Yale-NUS's social science courses are very strong, but you will have to take more of the initiative in terms of carving out your academic focus.\n\nHope that helped!"", 'Yale-NUS has financial aid though (depends on  applicant‚Äôs circumstance, but very low income students pay less for YNC than any other HEI in Singapore)', ""not true, especially if you're low-income -- I'm a current admit and I'm set to pay virtually nothing to attend Yale-NUS lmao. half of the student body is offered some form of aid as well. \n\ngood rule of thumb is to apply for financial aid regardless of your situation, because you'll never know how much the college will give you.""]","[1585128615.0, 1585149339.0, 1585132412.0, 1585159719.0, 1585185508.0]","[10, -2, 12, 4, 2]"

[Uni] Does MacBook Air have enough power for Comp Sci Major ?,University :snoo_smile:,1585110210.0,"I'm looking at getting the new MacBook Air in the following spec:

Intel i5 quad-core 10th gen, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD

However, I am not sure what computer science students do on their laptops exactly. Anything CPU heavy? The Air has very bad cooling so it throttles like crazy, so if I have to do CPU heavy tasks very frequently I'd better buy something else. 

Secondary Question for any laptop: If I can afford either 16 GB of RAM or 512 GB SSD, which should I choose?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fok2nc/uni_does_macbook_air_have_enough_power_for_comp/,5,"['Hi It will be best if you can afford 16gb of ram for your computer as you may need to run linux environment on your computer (which takes up a lot of memory). If you cannot afford to upgrade to 512ssd, have a spare hard drive in case there is not enough storage. Just sharing my personal opinion as I am currently poly student pursuing studies in cybersecurity', ""Am a comp science student in NTU.\n\nYes, macbook air is sufficient. Note that you should be familiar with macOS and unix tools as the school will tend to teach how to set up windows environment. Either that, or set up parallels/bootcamp with the free Windows 10 that the school gives you (check out https://onthehub.com/windows-10-education/). But so far virtually most of my projects have been platform agnostic (can be run on any OS)\n\nFor year 1-2 your main programming is basics in python and java which requires no particular OS and can run instantly (no stress on your CPU). Your code compiles in basically half a second. You might have to look for your own way to compile C, or use windows bootcamp.\n\nFor year 3, you may be doing more complex projects like web development, android dev etc. Macbook air is still sufficient but you might need the 16gb of ram if you're one of those ambitious groups doing huge projects.

If you're taking machine learning specialisation, you will need a desktop with a powerful GPU, although the school does provide you with GPU clusters or you can use google's online Colab (what I did). So you can still technically survive without a powerful laptop.\n\nI'd say, go for it!"", ""Don't get a Macbook. Likely in computer science you will be using apps that are windows based, meaning you will have to run Bootcamp or some other alternative. It makes it more inconvenient and lowers perceived performance since it will lack the optimisations that apple has made.

But as a NUS CS student who focused on computer networks and algorithm, I never really needed any OS specific software or require huge computational power. It was instead mostly theoretical, alot of paperwork and provings. \n\nSo I guess it boils down to the curriculum you're gonna focus on. I'd say any laptop can survive the introductory modules of NUS CS, you don't need specific laptop with high computing power.\n\nEdit: I use MacBook Pro 13 inch without touch bar 8gb ram. Also, there was one module that needed windows. I booted it via a external SSD and there was no lag or any other issues."", 'Thank you so much!', 'Thank you so much! This is great info.

[Poly] Questions about SP Biomed,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585035361.0,"hi, i am going to be a first year student in sp biomed and i have some questions.

1. What are the different specialisations about? The description given on the website is a bit short so I don't really know much.

2. How are exams conducted? Is it just open ended all the way?

3. What is the workload like?  Is it possible to manage if I choose to take up a cca and sign up for a foreign language programme?

4. Is there anything I can read or do to prepare myself before school starts?

5. What is the environment/culture like in biomed?

6. What are some scholarships I can apply for?

Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fo1221/poly_questions_about_sp_biomed/,11,"['Hello, I graduated from SP biomed last year. \n\n1) I was in the cardiac technology option and we went to National Heart Centre for most of our classes in the final year. My internship was at CGH and NHC in the cardiac lab department (we helped to do ECG on patients etc.). There‚Äôs also no final year project for this option because the internship grade takes the highest weightage. \n\nMedical technology will usually have the majority of students in the course because it‚Äôs the most general. If you‚Äôre not into research and cardiac technology by the end of the second year, it‚Äôs best to choose this option. Lots of lab work for this option. \n\nBiomed Research is well, has a great focus on research. Apologies that I can‚Äôt give much info on these two options as I was at NHC most of the time in the final year and was not in tune with what my course mates were doing. \n\n\n2) Exams/tests can be MCQ, open-ended or practical lab sessions. Most written exams are a mixture of MCQ and open-ended. \n\n\n3) The workload to me, is not that heavy to the point of having no free time at all. If you consistently keep up with revisions, having a CCA and foreign language class should be manageable. If not, you can drop out of your CCA at any time because there‚Äôs no obligation to have a CCA in polytechnic (ie. it‚Äôs not compulsory and you can have as many or no CCA as you want). CCA might help in your portfolio when applying for further studies. \n\n\n4) For basics, I‚Äôll definitely recommend being very familiar with secondary school biology and reading up on human anatomy/medical textbooks will help. It won‚Äôt be easy to remember everything but you can get a taster of the things you‚Äôll be learning on. \n\n\n5) Not really sure what you want to know about culture. As for competitiveness, I didn‚Äôt really feel much of it. There‚Äôs no bell curve in polytechnic, so everyone is pitched against the grading system and not against each other. So stay hardworking, keep up with your work, and you‚Äôll be fine. \n\n\n6) Can‚Äôt comment much on scholarships as I didn‚Äôt apply for them, but there will be more information on this when you matriculate.', 'thanks for replying', 'is there any recommendations on books?', 'Is there a set intake for each specialisiation? Is there any requirements to get into a specific specilisation?', 'This was the one we used in Year 1 on human anatomy: Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131934813/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_sIgFEbJ0A149J', 'For cardiac technology, there will be around 10 students out of 60 (which was the intake in my year). This is the smallest class out of the three, probably because it‚Äôs very specialised. There will be an interview at NHC that you‚Äôll have to pass to get into this option. The interview is like a chat with the senior medical technologists to evaluate your personality as the internship for this option is very patient-oriented. Additionally, 90% of the students for cardiac technology will be females because female students can carry out procedures such as ECG on both male and female patients while male students can only carry out procedures on male patients. \n\nBiomedical research takes in about 1/3 of the cohort. There are no entry requirements for research and medical technology. In fact, all three options are based on your interest and most students get their first choice of option. The only thing about cardiac tech is the interview. \n\nThe rest of the students who don‚Äôt end up in research and cardiac tech will be in the medical technology option, which usually takes in more than 1/3 of the cohort.\n\nEdit: Just saw the SP DBS site and found out that biotechnology is now the fourth option. Back in my cohort, biotech was a separate diploma on its own, so I don‚Äôt know much about that.', 'Oh cool thanks!']","[1585196006.0, 1585200650.0, 1585199258.0, 1585321103.0, 1585211583.0, 1585328519.0, 1585233399.0]","[3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]"

"[University] Animation in NTU, ADM",University :snoo_smile:,1585031046.0," I am currently a year 2 student in NYP Animation, going to year 3 this coming april. After two years of studies, I am very certain that animation is what I want to do in the future. My mum wants me to go to  uni directly after graduating, and the best option we're currently  looking at is ADM. But to be honest, there was not much I can get from their websites to know more about the course, so I want to find out more about how is ADM here? Like, for their animation specialization under Media arts,

1. Will I learn a lot more when I go there, or will I just be doing the same things I did in poly all over again?
2. Is the lecturers good and experienced?
3. Is there more 2d or 3d animation things?
4. Do they focus on animation?

When  I say learning more, I don't mean like as in gaining experience, but do they go more in depth in certain topics such as for 2d animation, color theory, drawing fundamentals, etc then they did in poly? And if they  focus on animation or not, because I heard from a friend that in ADM  they make you learn a lot of things and there's no focus on animation  even though the degree is called digital animation. The thing is, the source is from a person who graduated many years before, probably before 2010s, so I'm sure lots of things have changed since then til now. I am  looking to specialize in the 2d areas more,(pre-production and 2d  animation) and my lecturer said that NTU has became better over the  years in their 2d. But i wanna know how much have they improved and  whether it is a good school to go for or should I consider other  schools?(If so, which schools do y'all recommend?)

Also, is there a lot of opportunities for overseas exchange and internships for ADM students? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fo0agj/university_animation_in_ntu_adm/,16,[],[],[]

[Poly] Would joining a CCA help for Uni ?,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1585017751.0,"Would joining a CCA help for Uni ?

Im starting Poly soon and Ive seen some posts and comments on here which says that having a CCA will help a lot in your portfolio for entering a Uni while some say that it wouldnt matter as long as you have a good GPA.

I wasnt planning to join a CCA at all and wanted to focus academically but im not sure now

Update: Thx for all the comments. Ive read and it looks like the majority thinks that CCA is important not only to enter competitive Uni courses but to balance Poly life. Ive honestly gotten tired of committing to a CCA after holding a leadership role in my Uniform Group in secondary school which is why I didnt want to join a CCA. It's still March as well.

Personally, this helped me retain information a lot better because I became more consistent in my practices and memorising. It also helped me improve because I wasnt repeating my common mistakes and instead of memorising notes, i was memorising the ""model answers"" by different schools. Quizlet flashcards are accessible easily on phone so revision became more convenient in a way?

[O level] Need subject advise for private candidate based on situation,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1584888975.0,"Last minute but I need serious advice on my next steps. I‚Äôm 25 and only did N levels under advise from therapist that Lasalle makes exceptions based on audition/portfolio though O‚Äôs is entry requirement. She claimed having clients previously with N levels got accepted with just that.

Finishing NS I tried for Lasalle in 2015 but was told I can‚Äôt even audition because ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt meet the requirement‚Äô. Therapist then adviced to take a high school diploma program (US) online, took a year to complete before applying again in 2016. Ever since I have applied yearly and gotten rejected, including this year.

My dream is to study music composition / audio engineering and unfortunately SG doesn‚Äôt have much realated courses. My plan was a music related diploma in SG then pursue degree overseas. As far as I know there is Lasalle, NAFA and SP that offers 1 music course. Past 4 years I‚Äôve only applied to Lasalle but this year I applied for SP too under foreign qualifications with my high school dip. but got rejected (not sure why). Last year I applied for music composition at NAFA and 1 requirement was keyboard skills which I‚Äôm not too good at; so I got rejected as I expected. However for Lasalle, after attending auditions 5 years in a row I sense their expectations level is definitely not great as NAFA.

I accept that perhaps the first 3 years my portfolio wasn‚Äôt ‚Äògood enough‚Äô but I‚Äôve gotten a lot better. The lecturer that conducted my audition this year was full of praises for me and my work, at one point he loomed impressed saying ‚Äòthis here is very good work‚Äô. I‚Äôm there thinking finally after 5 years, this is it! Only to get a 5th rejection letter. So confused and clueless what went wrong, can‚Äôt be my pieces weren‚Äôt good enough or I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten those compliments.

Leaves me thinking perhaps they don‚Äôt accept my high school dip., they looked it up and saw its done online and don‚Äôt consider it legit? I have no idea‚Ä¶ On the verge of giving up my parents suggested doing O‚Äôlevels, which after 8 years leaving school is a nightmare. I don‚Äôt know how much of secondary school knowledge i retained and then to refresh plus learn more, makes me wanna cry. However I‚Äôm willing to bite the bullet and go for it, if that‚Äôs my only option.

However looking at the music course on SP‚Äôs site besides English & Math, there‚Äôs something about one of other subjects has to be one of the subjects listed. Looking through them I have no idea which subjects I have a chance of passing because there are restrictions taking subjects with practical component as private candidate and the subjects on the list are either not offered to private candidates or have a practical component. So I‚Äôm left desperately looking for what subjects besides English & Math that I can take that‚Äôll allow me to apply for the music course in SP next year.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gunning for as I feel like while I will still apply for Lasalle again, I could also be rejected again next year. I feel my chances are better at poly as a there‚Äòs no audition and tbh I just wanna get a start on my education already. It‚Äôs a very exhausting/frustrating journey. To be 25 and still not have a proper dip. is very demotivating and embarrassing. I‚Äôm afraid that I have to give up my ambitions in order to move up in life but I‚Äôm praying there is another way so I‚Äôm desperately looking for any advice from anyone. Unfortunately the sign up for O‚Äôs ends tomorrow (March 23) so I have to make a decision very soon.

Even if you don't answer the questions as well as others, it doesn't really matter cause what matters in the end is how you present yourself to them and your confidence! But of course, don't be too complacent and for questions that you really don't know the answer to (like maybe the one about the roles in the SU and their duties) then just be honest and tell them that you don't know.

How i managed to get better grades you ask? well I didn't, I continued to do like shit and feel like shit for MYCTs and Prelims despite studying cause there will always be gaps in your understanding and questions you aren't exposed to. I think there's always this self-doubt in all of us where we feel under-prepared for exams and stuff, but by the time I sat for the A levels, I didn't really care about how well I would potentially fare, as I was tired af from preparing and wanted to get this shit over with. So I basically just went in with the goal of doing my best, (no concrete targets or anything) and it worked out surprisingly well, did wayyyy better than expected. I guess the key would be to not stress yourself out too much because it would probably impede your ability to do well in the actual thing. at that point, you would have put in so many hours into revision, they would definitely mean something right?

I do see many of the better scorers being complacent and dropping off the list of top people. But anyways just dun worry u have the whole of June to work hard and dun use block exams as an indicator on how well u can do in As since it‚Äôs not even the full papers yet but more for what holes do u have in ur understanding or studying style. MYEs and Prelims are the ones with the actual exam format so be prepared to work hard after the block tests but do take rest occasionally when u feel some burnout.

If you planning to join CCA, hell period May be really hellish for you especially because the third language has test on it‚Äôs own too. \nI believe for all the courses in NP, to maintain a good GPA, firstly, you must be really well liked by your Teachers.

I won‚Äôt speak for other schools but in NP, my timetable on average starts at around 9/10am and end school around 4/5pm. CCA will definitely be at night at around 7pm until around 9pm but again, the ending time depends on the CCA. Sure, I‚Äôve several friends who work after school during poly because there some days in your timetable you‚Äôll end early like around 3/4pm then can rush to your place for night shift.

The school will choose internships for you and like you to choose from them. However, you can also self source your own intern and tell your teacher in charge about it. They‚Äôll do a check on that company before approving your intern. \n2. CCAs are not compulsory. However, it is up to you whether or not you want to commit. Some CCAs are really competitive and if you want to be on the team, naturally you‚Äôll commit more but if you‚Äôre not about competitions and just wanna have fun, there are like recreational teams for sports cca so like you can just go as you wish and just have fun. \n3. Foreign language you can either take as IS (elective module) or can take as diploma plus which is stay back once a week. How manageable, I‚Äôm honestly unsure because I didn‚Äôt take LOL but it definitely adds up to the stress level during hell period when there are assignments and exams you need to prepare for then you have to study for your 3rd language also.\n4. If you planning to go local unis, JC would be a better option because most intake will be for JC kids. In poly, to go into good local unis, you need to have a gpa of around 3.8 to be able to qualify safely. And that is extremely hard to attain. Hence, many poly kids either go priv uni or less reputable local uni or overseas uni. Either that, they‚Äôll take a gap year, go to work and build up their portfolio before trying for uni applications again.\n5. There isn‚Äôt any PE lessons in NP. In your first or second semester, there‚Äôll be SnW whereby you‚Äôll choose a sport of your interest and they‚Äôll ballot i think. Then once a week, you‚Äôll have 1 lesson on that particular sports but it won‚Äôt affect your gpa. In year 3, there‚Äôs an elective called Pfit which you‚Äôll learn about gyming and muscles but it‚Äôs up to you if you wanna take that elective or not. Again, they‚Äôll ballot. \n6. Yup there‚Äôs a general studies module in your final year on like current issues and you‚Äôve to write reports about it. \nHope it helps!', '1. CCA points are calculated by the events you participate in. Example, pol-ite matches, showcases, volunteer work, etc. If you‚Äôre in camp, there‚Äôll be participation and leadership point depending on your role in the camp.\n\n2. No, you don‚Äôt have to get A for everything. That‚Äôs because you‚Äôve core modules which has higher credit units than elective modules. Hence, some core modules weigh as heavy as 8 credit units which is four times more than elective modules. Therefore, you‚Äôve to do well for modules with higher credit units but try to do well for all if possible as everything plays a part. However, you need to maintain a gpa 4.0 all the way for 3 years to graduate with 4.0\n\n3. Most things are online now. Your notes are basically your lecture slides, your tutorials will be in Microsoft words and your submission will be via an online platform. The only scenario where paper would be used will be exams and when you‚Äôre doing notes or if you print out your lecture slides for revisions purposes.\n\n4. This depends on your lecturer. Some Lecturers will give students a grace period of 15mins while some are damn Cb and mark you late/absent by seconds. Hence, this is really dependent on your lecturer. Do note that, excuses regarding traffic or stomachs isn‚Äôt very welcomed LOL. They just don‚Äôt work because no one is stupid enough to believe.\n\n5. You‚Äôll have a mentor definitely which will be teaching you stuff like portfolio, work etiquette and help you source internships, etc. And the Lecturers for every modules will be different and same in some, depends on what module that lecturer teach.', 'I would say poly a lot more lenient as compared to sec school because unlike sec school Teachers, poly Lecturers won‚Äôt really care about you outside his/her class.\nFirstly, poly dress sense is really up to you.

If you never hand up, marks deducted for that assignment, simple as that.', 'Every sem besides your intern sem, there will be IS modules so nope, no cases of students not taking IS. In NP, before every sem start, NP will send you an SMS reminder to tell you to go rank the IS module of your choice from favourite to least favourite. There‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll get what you want but usually you will, depending on the demand of that IS module. And Yes, IS modules do affect GPA. In my course, IS is 2 credit unit. Although not much, but it do affect. If you‚Äôre rushing your IS assignment and core module assignment, obviously focus on your core module assignment first but if you can, please do well for IS modules as well.', '1. Yes final Assignments usually have very heavy weightage. Either as heavy or heavier than final exams. Normal class tutorials and assignments plays a small part too like 10-20%\n2. Yes all courses will require report and presentations one. This is something you cannot get away from. As long as there is an assignment, there‚Äôll be a presentation so that the teacher can know if the work is done by you. And even if core module doesn‚Äôt have reports, your Elective module will have. Modules that doesn‚Äôt have reports will be like programming.\n3. No CCA is actually not that important. Local uni doesn‚Äôt look at your CCA records unless there‚Äôs special case uh. You can go Google, last time I read, local uni doesn‚Äôt look at your PEARL (CCA points) anymore. Not so sure about scholarship but yes you can just participate in a CCA and you‚Äôll be rewarded points for events you help out in or community services that you volunteered for.\nHope this helps!', 'Honestly, recreational team for CCA is pretty chill!! So if you think your assignments are piling and your exams are coming, just don‚Äôt go for the trainings for the time period.

First of, I‚Äôve no idea what CSC is so I can‚Äôt really say much but in general, if you wanna join Comm of a club, There‚Äôs definitely commitment. That‚Äôs because you‚Äôve to be there to help out and plan the activities and stuff liddat. So if you ask me, you‚Äôll definitely be busier and feel more stressful academically. Not just that, since you know more people, your social life will get busier also so you‚Äôll go out more, text more people and supper after cca kinda stuff. Hence, your results may get affected but it really depends on how you cope with it. If you can handle it well, having an extra commitment isn‚Äôt a problem. If your gpa is like below 3 already, just have fun bro', 'Hi sorry, I‚Äôm not inside climbing cca so I really can‚Äôt advice if they‚Äôre competitive or not :( but if you‚Äôre really keen, you can always go for try outs and try your luck!!

Like if next time you plan on going overseas to study then that foreign language would be more useful uh. \n\n3. Foreign language is a lesson per week, CCA is dependent on the type of CCA and what position you‚Äôre in. If you‚Äôre in sports CCA, would be 2-3 trainings per week for competitive and 1-2 training for recreational. If you‚Äôre in dance, usually is 1 prac a week but when there‚Äôs performance or production, can be as bad as every single day in a week. If you joining student union and let‚Äôs say you get selected as gl, the commitment is much higher. Hence, I would say it‚Äôs quite unrealistic if you wanna work, cca, foreign language and still get a good enough gpa for Uni.\n\n4. KCC is a Korean dance club whereby you‚Äôll learn choreographies from Kpop MVs. You don‚Äôt learn the dance genres or the basics but instead, you learn moves from MVs. And there‚Äôll be kpop competition held annually and a production too. \n\n5. Nope, CCA isn‚Äôt that important. \n\n6. For dance studios, only CCAs can use. However, you can force the door open and use uh LOL. Gym is accessible to all students\n\n7. Nope, don‚Äôt think about it so much. As long as you really study before your test and really do all your assignments properly, you‚Äôll do well. Also, don‚Äôt get shitty group mates.\n\n8. Depends on your timetable one. There are breaks that are an hour Long or even 4 hours Long. \n\n9. Pretty average Mala. Nicest I would say is makan place Mala. King Kong curry is nice too.

Your teacher will only assign when there is a conflict like someone is discriminated and no one wants to take him/her into the group then the teacher will self assign.

Do you use a external hard drive or something for extra storage?\n\nCurrently My laptop currently is doing fine, I think. But does meeting the recommended specs for your course matter? I know engineering and graphic design requires  a powerful computer. But if you fall under that what happens? is it an inconvenience or a major problem?"", '1: Do Projects use a lot of space?\nHonestly for the most part in general electives, you will most likely collaborate with your group members through google docs because everyone can work in real-time and facing reality; not many people enjoy meet ups or face to face anymore(idk why, I have this problem with my group members). So I don‚Äôt think storage is really an issue if you mostly go virtual and empty your space after each semester from your comp (but do keep backups maybe on google drive personally because usually engineering modules are pre-requisites to the following engineering modules).\n\n2: Recommended specs?\nI‚Äôm from an electronics course in NP, honestly for the most part, the idea is to ensure you don‚Äôt have a computer that freezes, lags or gives you blue screen of death out of a sudden as there are usually key moments in where you need it to work well and not die especially during lab tests or during your rendering in autoCAD (it‚Äôs a program which you‚Äôll likely use for rendering models). So I guess you may want to ask some of the seniors what software they used and test them on your own computer and do your own decision afterwards? If it is likely to breakdown or randomly lags, then I guess it‚Äôs time for a new laptop.\n\nHope this helped!', 'I see, thanks a lot for the help!

For CS/Engin majors you probably won‚Äôt have as many essays to write (max 2-6 modules that require essay writing over the 4 years, depending on your GEs as well). Lesser MCQs, more take home assignments/problem sets would be the general idea.\n\n3.how to keep up with uni (e.g. consistency in work which i didn‚Äôt have in jc :\\ ) \n\nConsistency obviously helps, but may not be necessary for some people.

When normal classes resume it generally gets easier as you‚Äôll be ‚Äòforced‚Äô to think about every module every week.\n\n4. structure of curriculum ‚Äî> lecture tutorial style?? how fast-paced are lectures/tutorials \n\nAlmost all modules will have at least 1 lecture slot per week, most will pair with one tutorial, some with labs. Sometimes lectures and tutorials are interchangeable, depending on what the prof wants to go through.\n\n5.what is the earliest time lectures start because i have to travel 1+ h to reach sch\n\n8am I think.

I‚Äôm from another course in RP but I‚Äôll try my best to help u with ur queries!! RP approach of learning would be problem-based which means that for every lesson, your team would be tasked to answer the problem statement (given in the morning) and to present your solutions during phase 3 to the class (presentation). One day is broken up into phase 1, 2 and 3. \n1. Homework and exams are done mostly on our laptops unless specified otherwise by your lecturer. Exams are mostly open-book whereby you are allowed to refer to your notes stored in your laptop or paper-bounded notes (depending on module).\n2. If u wish to do up your own notes u can!! At the end of phase 3 (after all teams present their solutions), the lecturer will go through the 6P. 6P is basically what you have learnt for the entire day (6P would be released at the end of the week and it can be accessed and downloaded on your laptop).

Like a example wud be visual text qn whr they show u the picture then ask why they put the picture. The technique wud be smth along the lines of analysing the picture and describing it and explaining how it links to the qn. eg. the picture depicts ________ which suggests that ________. And the same for section b the 1st qn whr ur supposed to quote and emphasize on ur ans. Eg. ""Quote the quote"" emphasizes how/that____(change word given in the qn abt the description with a synonymous word. And for summary read the qn properly and ATQ,  highlight the points and then write a draft and edit before writing it on the ans key.\n\nFor listening compre idk how help u ahah just make sure u have 100% attention when u go in and focus esp on the last part.\n\nFor oral be confident af. Like legit if u not confident fake it until you make it. Stop using signlish for a whole week before oral. During oral always try to involve personal exp and make sure its either sad/happy/funny. And try not to lie luh unless u a good liar cos if not u will get caught on ur lie one. Be specific when u give details abt ur personal experience and if u can try to slide in humour. Like if the qn is abt going overseas u can say udl it cos u miss ur mom when going overseas and altho ppl say ur a mommas boy ur proud of it and that u love her and then tell them abt a trip u went on or wtvr.

[JC] Opinions on ACJC,Junior Colleges :karma:,1584791952.0,"Just a little about me, I'm a J1 in ACJC and I'm still trying to wrap my head around the kind of school I'm in right now.

No offence to all the great ACJC students whom I know are out there somewhere but I can't help but wonder if ACJC, being mid-tier based on its COP, gravitates towards the likes of elite institutions or is more akin to a neighbourhood school that draws its prestige from its heritage in terms of the quality of education it provides.

I've heard some label it as an institution in the likes of VJC or TJC so I'm confused as to what to make of what people tell me about where my school stands.

The worst aspect I feel is how sports CCA are seen as superior to clubs. One  example include how some sports CCA have reserved tables in the void deck (a place where students can eat or study) and it often causes displeasure when you sit at those reserved tables. I guess this is because ACJC sports cca often produce good results and seem to contribute more to the school hence, creating the sense of superiority.\n\nFor the arts department, I think Acjc has one of the best arts department in all of Singapore‚Äôs jcs. The history/econs department produces one of the highest distinction rate at the yearly a level exams. They also offer some special subjects like theatre studies.

[O Levels] My Higher Chinese Journey,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:,1584784588.0,"I'm posting this to encourage people who are having problems with Chinese/Higher Chinese. I encountered many obstacles as a private candidate, but managed to pull it through.

21 September 2018 was the day I said in impulse that I want to take A level Chinese after seeing my GPA drop from 3.46 to 3.32, because I really want to study linguistics in NTU (the 10th percentile GPA for linguistics was 3.53 at that time). I remember one of my friends (treat him as friend A, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) helped me to check my results and said it was ""good"". After seeing it myself I concluded that it was really bad. By September 2018, I kinda lost interest in my polytechnic course. At that time, I was very dejected. I had 2 choices for Chinese if I really wanted to choose the linguistics path, A Level Chinese or O Level Higher Chinese. I chose O Level Higher Chinese, and bought the TYS. After looking at 2017's paper and realising how bad I was in Chinese, I decided to take a step back and buy Sec 1 HCL books to increase my vocabulary. I gradually bought sec 2 and 3 ones to get used to ÁóÖÂè•ÊîπÊ≠£. I started doing comprehension exercises in November 2018 with secondary 2B ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ. I worked very hard to increase my vocabulary and get used to ÁóÖÂè•ÊîπÊ≠£, as well as paper 2 formats. 

On 7 November 2018, I emailed NTU and asked if A Level Chinese/O Level HCL is required for polytechnic students to apply for linguistics. The next day, they replied that those are not necessary for application. I had studied for about a month, and was definitely not willing to let my efforts go to waste. Hence I decided to take Higher Chinese as a means of opening more routes. From then on, I became more serious about taking Higher Chinese and made some arrangements to study during weekends. My purpose of taking Higher Chinese gradually changed.

In late November 2018, I remember I stopped studying for JLPT N2 (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) since late September 2018 as I was too fixated on Chinese (wanting to study linguistics was probably one of the reasons I worked very hard in Chinese). I knew I needed to get back to Japanese as JLPT was drawing nearer, or else I won't do well (it happened lol, I screwed up on the reading portion).. there was a period of time in November 2018 when I was very stressed (needed to balance Japanese and Chinese, and had internship). I remember friend A told me that I needed to choose between Chinese and Japanese. JLPT was drawing nearer, and I cannot give up on it. I have studied for the N2 since December 2017 and I cannot just give up like that, as it would mean I will let my Japanese friends who helped me for N2 and N3 down. That was also a period of crossroads. After taking JLPT N2, I felt really regretful as I messed up. I decided to retake N2 someday, but for now I just want to focus on Chinese. Some time after JLPT, I helped a friend with English-Japanese translation for his immersion trip. While doing the translation, I was really touched as I managed to convey the messages of the exchange students to the homestay families in Japan. I then realised that translation is really the bridge between 2 cultures, and we are the bridge between 2 countries/cultures. I encountered several problems while translating as Japanese has a lot of ÊÉØÁî®ËØ≠ but lesser words than English. English-Japanese translation is really challenging. I got some help from my Japanese friend while translating. From then on, I really want to be a translator, to bridge the gap between 2 cultures.

From mid-December 2018 to January 2019, I returned to studying Chinese, improving my vocabulary with secondary 3-4 ËØ≠ÊñáÂ∫îÁî® books, while doing a lot of practice (especially reading). I had 3 plans in mind at that time.

1) Take Higher Chinese in 2019
2) Take Higher Chinese in 2020 (more time to prepare)
3) Take Higher Chinese in 2019 (as experience) and 2020

I supposed taking Higher Chinese in 2019 was dangerous as I had no prior experience and I never studied it in secondary school. I got B3 for normal O Level Chinese (merit in oral) in 2014, making the climb steeper. Hence, I decided to take in 2019 to experience, and go all in in 2020. However, friend A told me not to do that, and advised me to just do my best in 2019. 

I met someone online (treat him as friend B, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) in late January 2019. When he knew that I was planning to take Higher Chinese, he gave me a lot of tips and encouraged me to keep going.

February 2019 was the month which I sprained and fractured my left foot. I remember having to report to work with my swollen foot. That was the main reason I was downgraded from PES B1 to C9, and my enlistment was delayed (I was supposed to enlist on 11 May 2019 as I did not pass IPPT in school). That kinda gave me more time to study, especially oral (oral is in July, if I enlisted in May I would need to take leave to go for the exam in July. Missing a session in BMT also makes it hard to catch up). The fracture was somewhat a blessing in disguise. 

By February 2019, I was chatting frequently with friend B. He helped to check my language, and also taught me a lot of things. He gave me a lot of advice in HCL, and was willing to mentor me for HCL. He is one of the people I look up to. 

I bought summary writing books in February 2019 and started learning the format of summary writing. My internship also ended in mid-February 2019. February was a time of foundation strengthening and vocabulary building. 

In March 2019, I focused a lot on vocabulary. I also started writing articles on Chinese Wikipedia to improve my standard of writing. It gave me more exposure to writing and improved my writing ability. I supposed that will be helpful for my composition. Throughout March 2019, friend B helped me a lot in HCL. He also encouraged me to persevere on for HCL.

As time passed by, my purpose of taking Higher Chinese changed. I decided to HCL as I wanted to make up for my bad Chinese results in secondary school, at the same time giving me more opportunities for translation. I could also fulfill translation course requirements as I fell short of the requirements (translation became one of my university choices, other than linguistics). Chinese slowly became an interest, rather than a language.

April 2019 was the start of private O Level applications. At that time, I wasn't sure if I really should apply for Higher Chinese. Hence I started a thread on Reddit and asked for advice. Many people gave me advice about Higher Chinese, and one of them PM'ed me on Reddit. They said that they are also interested in translation. They took Higher Chinese in 2018. They (treat them as friend C, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) gave me a lot of advice for HCL and shared their experiences as a candidate last year. I decided to apply for Higher Chinese in 2019. I still remembered friend A's advice, go all in in 2019, don't hesitate. At that time, I was kinda afraid that I will do poorly for HCL, so I wanted to take it as an experience. However, I thought to myself that since I'm already intending to take it in 2019, I ought to give in my 100%, and not just take it as an experience. Friend C also advised me to do my best and not think about retaking in 2020. I decided to go all in in 2019, and not think about retaking in 2020.

I bought a textbook for secondary 1-3 students in Malaysia in mid-April and found it really useful. I learnt many vocabulary pairs and ÊàêËØ≠, at the same time improving my overall ability.

In late April 2019, I started learning more about ‰øÆËæûÊâãÊ≥ï (with the Malaysian textbook), ËÆ∫ËØÅÊñπÊ≥ï and ËØ¥ÊòéÊñπÊ≥ï. Friend C helped me to adapt to the HCL syllabus. There was a period of time when I was fearful of the syllabus as I had no prior experience and a lot of things were new to me. My language ability was also not that good, hence I was afraid that I will do poorly for the exam. I still had 6-7 months to study for the exam. Since I submitted the application, I ought to do well. 

Friend B and C motivated me to continue to persevere on for HCL, they really helped and encouraged me a lot especially when I was discouraged. April and May 2019 were still a time of vocabulary building, I was still afraid to touch comprehension and composition as I was afraid I will not do well. According to my original plan, I was supposed to start comprehension in March 2019, but I was afraid to do so. I should have started comprehension earlier. I should stop being afraid of making mistakes. If I start comprehension late, it will slow down my progress. In May 2019, I started writing long essays and showed friend B and C. They gave me advice on how to improve my essays.

I focused more on comprehension and summary writing in June 2019, at the same time writing compositions. I mainly focused on ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü, as I had little confidence in ËÆ∞ÂèôÊñá and ËÆÆËÆ∫Êñá. I used to write a lot of narrative essays in secondary school, but never wrote ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü (not even 1!) at all. Narrative essays used to be my forte in secondary school, but I don't think I can think of good plots now. I knew that I was taking some risk when I chose to focus on ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü. Thankfully, friend C gave me plenty of study resources,including a ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü book. I read through the writing guides and sample essays to get used to the format. I wrote several ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü and showed friend B. He gave me some advice on improving the content and language. Anyway, I had trouble with time management as I exceeded the time limit every time I wrote essays (sometimes 2 hours). I still have ÂÆûÁî®Êñá to complete in the 2 hours. If I fail to manage my time well and increase my writing speed, I will not do well for paper 1. I knew I still have a lot to improve, I was a bit discouraged when I saw my progress. I received my enlistment letter in June 2019 and it states that I was slated to enlist in August 2019. Seeing how little time I had left, I knew I had to be mentally prepared for more obstacles and challenges. By the way, I was still practising comprehension with secondary 2 assessment books, and friend C told me to buy secondary 4 ones instead. But I knew I was not ready for that. After completing secondary 2B ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ, I proceeded with secondary 3A ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ (I bought this book a while ago). I was rather surprised when I saw the jump in difficulty from 2B to 3A. 

I started to practise paper 2 in July 2019. When I did my first paper 2, I ran out of time. I left summary writing blank, failing the paper in the end. I felt a bit discouraged, but I was determined to carry on. I then tried another paper 2. This one was slightly better than the previous one, I could complete the paper, but it was very rushed. Time management was not done very well, but I could see some improvement. I realised that time management is crucial, hence I made it a point to improve on time management. I practised another paper 2, and this time felt much better than the previous two. I still had a lot to improve, but I was relieved when I saw some improvement. 

I also practised some oral (Âè£Â§¥Êä•Âëä/‰ºöËØù), as oral was in July 2019. This syllabus is totally new to me, as it was ÁúãÂõæËØ¥ËØù when I was in secondary school. I heard that oral was added into the HCL syllabus in 2016. Thankfully, friend C helped me to familiarise with the new syllabus and practised oral with me. If not I would be completely lost.

I remember some time before oral exam, I contemplated if I should look for my primary school Chinese tuition teacher. I knew that I should not always rely on my friends, as they are very busy. I have not met my tuition teacher for years, so I was not sure if that is appropriate. After some consideration, I decided to seek advice (and ask for tuition if possible) from my previous tuition teacher (have to admit that I did not like Chinese tuition homework when I was a primary school kid, ‰π†Â≠ó and Âê¨ÂÜô are what I hated in the past, but as I grew up I began to appreciate her efforts). She asked me why I decided to take Higher Chinese, so I explained to her my reasons. I also mentioned that I have been preparing for some time. I mentioned that I will be enlisting in August 2019, to which she asked how do I come for tuition when I'm in NS. I showed her the essays and paper 2 which I had done. I told her that I encountered problems during the preparation. She gave me a lot of advice for paper 1 and 2. For composition, read extensively to gain more knowledge. Her advice revolved around reading and exposure. Exposure myself to more sectors/areas so that I have more ideas for composition. Also, ensure that my ËÆ∫ÊçÆ is sufficient and avoid factual errors. She mentioned that teachers have many scripts to mark, hence they will not have time to look into details. The teachers look for the quality in content and language. As for comprehension, learn how model answers in top school papers are written (the format, way of expressing etc) and adjust my way of expressing accordingly. She said that if I master the way of answering the questions, my answers will be more complete. I followed her advice and found it beneficial. She affirmed my ability and told me that I will be fine for Higher Chinese without tuition. She told me to write another essay and show her, but I got a bit lazy and I was too fixated with a Chinese debate show which my friend recommended. Spent my free time watching the debate show instead aww. I felt a bit bad that I spent more time watching shows than practising composition.

On the actual oral exam day, I was rather nervous, partially because I was the only private candidate. I did not have a good sleep the previous night. The inviligator asked me if I wanted to go first, but I chose not to as I wanted more time to prepare. He told me that I would be the last to go if I let other students go first. I was fine with that, as I could take my time to prepare. I looked through the ÊàêËØ≠, Ë∞öËØ≠ and Ê†ºË®Ä in my Malaysian book, and the ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü book which my friend gave me, and thought of what to use during the exam. A lot of thoughts went through my mind when I was in the waiting room. What if I don't do well? Will it affect my paper 1 and 2? I knew that my paper 1 and 2 were not good. When it was my time to go, I took a deep breath. I remember expecting the topic to be fake news or digital defence, but when I saw the topic (‰Ω†ËÆ§‰∏∫Êàë‰ª¨Â∫îËØ•‰øùÁïô‰πåÊïèÂ≤õÁöÑËá™ÁÑ∂È£éË≤åÂêó), I was a bit surprised. I was not very confident about this topic, partially because I haven't been to Pulau Ubin for a long time. The last time I went to Pulau Ubin was a NPCC camp in secondary school. Hence, I am not very familiar with the oral topic. Nevertheless, I decided to make do with what I had, taking notes while watching the video. 10 minutes of preparation was up, and it was my time to go. Âè£Â§¥Êä•Âëä was still okay, but when I was about to conclude my report, the teacher stopped me, saying that 2 minutes is up. Conversation started, but it did not go well. I was very nervous, as such I stuttered a lot. I also paused for a while trying to collect my thoughts. I remember one of the questions the teacher asked: How should we protect the ÈáéÁîüÂä®Áâ© in Pulau Ubin? I gave a pretty nonsensical answer (build a farm) as I was very nervous and my mind was blank at that time. After that, the teacher asked me if I had anything else to elaborate. I thought this was the time to ÂäõÊåΩÁãÇÊæú (turn the tables) and summarised my previous points while adding some new content. I told my friends my experience after the exam, and said that I screwed up. I was kinda disappointed after the exam. Friend C told me to turn the disappointment into motivation and strength, and to improve on my writing ability to do well for the remaining papers.

By August 2019, I was a bit behind plan. While I had exposure to ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü and paper 2, I still needed to learn the formats of ÂÆûÁî®Êñá. ÂçöÂÆ¢ and ËÆ∫Âùõ were new to me, so I decided to buy a book for that. My ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü was not great, as I exceeded the time limit for my essays. Paper 2 was still okay.

In August 2019, I practised comprehension, Ê¶ÇËø∞ and ËØÑËø∞ with the Malaysian book I bought in April. I made it a goal to complete those exercises before enlistment. I knew that I won't have a lot of time to study once I enlist. 4 days before enlistment, I went to Popular and bought a guide book for ÂÆûÁî®Êñá. I brought it with me during enlistment, hoping for some study time in BMT. My bunk environment was not really productive for studying (PES C BMT military training phase is at Kranji Camp), as there are only two tables. Hence, I decided to just read my ÂÆûÁî®Êñá guide and more editorials online. Thankfully, I had quite a lot of free time during the military training phase of BMT. Hence I could do some summary writing practice. There were certainly many distractions in BMT. There were times I felt too tired to study, and I should bond more with my bunkmates too. I was posted to AFTC (Air Force Training Command) for my vocational training phase of BMT. I did not have a lot of free time in AFTC, as compared to Kranji Camp. Even so, I tried to study whenever I could at night. Thankfully, my bunk at AFTC has tables, so I could study at night. I did summary writing exercises from a summary writing book and comprehension exercises from secondary 4A ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ whenever I could (I did not finish 3A, decided to jump to 4A so that I will be more prepared for the real exam). I also revised during weekends. I managed to complete the 4A book just before the vocational training phase of BMT ended). I decided to buy sec 4B ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ for extra practice (asked Friend A and B for advice before buying, they said that extra practice is good too, only did one exercise though aww). Then came POP and bloc leave in October 2019. I knew that time was running out (the real exam is on 6 November). When bloc leave started, I only had 2.5 weeks left.

I went to Melaka when bloc leave started and hanged out with my BMT mates the day after I returned from Melaka. I did not really revise much on those days. On 24 October 2019 (Thursday), I decided to write a ÊùêÊñôËØªÂêéÊÑü as I had not written any for about 3 months. I was rather discouraged after writing it as I exceeded the time limit again... It was about 8.20pm when I finished the essay, I decided to cycle to look for my primary school Chinese tuition teacher. I actually still remembered the deal from 3 months ago. But when I reached the place, I realised that she had left. I showed friend A and C the essay which I had written, and asked them for their opinion. Friend C said that my content was okay, but there were structural errors. Friend A told me to read the essay again, and try to see if I made any grammatical error. I was kinda dejected that I was still making such errors at this point of time. I only had 1.5 weeks left, and I could not afford such errors at this point of time. Seeing how underprepared I was, I thought to myself, what if I don't do well this year, would I need to retake... I had some fear in my heart too. I wrote another essay and showed friend C, and they commented that it was better than the previous one in terms of structure.

About a week before the exam, I fell very sick (down with flu, sore throat and cough). I continued to practise ÂÆûÁî®Êñá despite the fact that I was sick, as that is one thing which I had neglected (despite reading guide books and knowing the format). Despite being sick, I went back to camp. But I was not able to study Chinese as I was lethargic and feeling very unwell. I decided to sleep at 8.30pm, hoping to recover soon so that I can study. The flu lasted for a few days. I mostly recovered when I returned home on the weekend. But there was little time left. 4 days left before the actual exam... When I returned to camp on the Monday (4 November), I practised a paper 2, as a confidence bolster before the real exam. I have not done any timed paper 2 for a while now, so I decided to do one. I knew that there was nothing much I can do now, as there were only 2 days left. The paper went okay, I managed to complete the paper on time. On the day before the exam, there was a social cohesion with my vocational mates. I remember playing bowling, and seeing how I started with 8, 9 and strike but ended with 5 and 6, I was afraid that my paper the next day will go the same way. My vocation course coordinator allowed me to go home after the cohesion and take half day leave the next day. I went home and did my final preparation (looked through ‰øÆËæûÊâãÊ≥ï, ËÆ∫ËØÅÊñπÊ≥ï, ËØ¥ÊòéÊñπÊ≥ï, ÊèèÂÜôÊñπÊ≥ï and ÂÆûÁî®Êñá format again). I did not want to go intense, so I watched a Chinese show before revising the essentials. I slept around 10+ and woke up around 6.15am the next day. 

It is finally the day of the exam. The fated 6 November has come. I walked to the exam site and just used my phone before the exam. I did not want to give myself too much stress. I remember telling my friends that I was quite nervous. Then paper 1 started. I started with the ËÆ∫Âùõ/ÂçöÂÆ¢ question, I remember it was about water conservation. While writing the situational writing, my mind blanked out. I could not think of how to continue my essay. Seeing that I was 30 minutes into the paper, I was kinda worried. I took a deep breath and continued writing. When I was 35 minutes in, I realised that I better start writing my comprehension as I may run out of time. I ended my situational writing hurriedly and abruptly (it was not very good). I jumped to composition 40 minutes into the paper. Realising that I only had 1 hour and 20 minutes left, I thought to myself, I better write quickly. As I was writing my essay, I realised that time was running out. Hence I wrote as fast as I could. When I reached the conclusion, I only had 3 minutes left. I rushed to write my conclusion (even made a mistake at the conclusion, wrote Áªº as Áªò as I was in a rush). Time was up, and I did not have time to read my essay. Fingers crossed, hoping that the essay will be fine. I managed to complete both essays just on time, but did not have time to read through them. Hence I was kinda worried. I decided to just move on, as paper 2 is equally important. Paper 2 started, it was pretty okay at the beginning. Cloze passage and sentence correction felt okay, I then proceeded with the first comprehension passage. But because I was kinda afraid that I made errors in cloze passage and sentence correction, I went to look at it again. I started doing the second comprehension passage about 35 minutes into the paper (about 70 minutes left). The second comprehension passage took me some time. When I saw that I was running out of time, I left the last question of the second passage incomplete, hoping to come back later when I finish the third passage and summary writing. The third passage felt rushed (had about 25-30 minutes left). I completed the first four questions in the third passage hurriedly, and jumped to summary writing. When I reached summary writing, I only had 5 minutes left. I picked out the key points and wrote my summary hurriedly. Did not know if I exceeded 80 words, but I knew I had enough. Did not have time to indicate the number of words (while I was counting the invigilator said time's up).. Managed to complete the paper (with the exception of the incomplete question and failure to indicate the number of words for summary writing). Both paper 1 and 2 felt rushed, I completed both papers just on time. Did not know how I did for paper 1, as it felt very rushed. As for paper 2, when I knew I got full marks for cloze passage and the three comprehension MCQ questions, I felt relieved that I secured 16 marks in paper 2. But comprehension was not that great. When I calculated my total score, I predicted that I would get around B3/B4 for the entire exam. My initial target was A2, hence I was not sure if I could hit the target. I knew the paper was over, and my preparation journey has ended. I encountered many obstacles, but was glad that it is over. I decided to move on and wait for the results.

Overall, the vocabulary building throughout the preparation helped a lot in cloze passage and composition. I remember getting 2/5 for my first Higher Chinese cloze passage. I knew that I had to work hard on vocabulary if I wanted to do well. My language foundation was not good, I kinda ÂæóËøá‰∏îËøá and neglected Chinese in secondary school. I knew it was never too late to improve, I am glad that I made the impulsive decision back in September 2018. I could improve on my Chinese for translation. Throughout the preparation, I did extensive reading and built my vocabulary base. I somewhat relied on general knowledge for content, but I also relied on practice to get used to the format. There were certainly flaws in my strategy too. I did not practise enough composition, and this explains why my composition was really rushed. Comprehension was still okay, I got plenty of practice from various books (secondary 2B/3A/4A ‰π†È¢òÁ≤æÁºñ and the Malaysian book). If I could reconstruct my strategy, I would have done more vocabulary application, by writing more essays so that I use and apply what I have learnt. I could also have reviewed my composition and read more sample essays/editorials to see what I lack. I should also practise more timed paper 1 and 2, so that the real exam would not be so rushed. It is good to review what I have done correctly and wrongly, and improve from here. The exam preparation journey has ended, but the language learning journey has not. I know I have a lot to improve, so I will continue to work hard from here. It has been a tough journey. I am grateful to my friends who supported and helped me throughout the journey. 

Fast forward to results day, I was very worried and nervous. I was not sure what my preparation and hard work will lead to. When I opened the website and checked my results, it showed... A2!!! With a merit in oral. I was overjoyed and relieved that my hard work paid off! It was really a miracle, I did not expect it all. It was certainly not just my hard work, my friends who helped me deserve the biggest credit. My primary school Chinese tuition teacher has some credit for this too. I knew very well that I would not have done it without their help and support. This is only the beginning, I will work hard to improve my Chinese ability.

TLDR: I am a private candidate who took Higher Chinese in 2019. I made an impulsive decision to take Higher Chinese for NTU linguistics in September 2018 when I saw my GPA drop from 3.46 to 3.32.

I encountered many obstacles during the preparation, but managed to pull it through in the end.

[A levels] Need tips for H2 Geog please,A Levels :snoo:,1584778541.0,"Hi! I'm taking H2 geog in jc, (I'm a J1) and I'm having trouble answering questions for tutorials and worksheets. My school notes for Geography are horrifying, because they're very vague, and the explanations for a lot of certain concepts are very generalized. I can understand them but they don't help me answer certain questions, or have a clearer grasp on the ideas. 

When the tutor goes through the homework and shows the answers for corrections, it feels like they just can't be bothered to do it properly and give us the very superficial points and expect us to link it back without explaining. 

What can I do to improve my Geography and how do I go about making my own notes? Should I buy guidebooks and are there any reccomendations? I've tried watching videos online such as NatGeo or National Weather Service but sometimes they do not provide explanations as well, for example I can't find anything on ICTZ or Hadley Cell on the website.

Got an A for the A levels last year so would like to share haha. I made my notes in the form of answering essay questions, like for each topic i had a few essay questions in a google docs which i answered. Found it a good way to come up with points for evaluation instead of giving a descriptive answer. \nFor the topics that require diagrams like for itcz I googled for images and tried to practice adding in depth annotations which i referenced off Wikipedia. Does your school give readings? It would b good to take examples off the readings and get evaluation points from them as well. My school gave us ‚Äògeofile‚Äô readings that were quite helpful. I also had the same problem of teachers not teaching much in class, so I arranged consultations with my tutor to ask how to write certain essays and clarify content. \nI think it‚Äôs more  important to learn the skills of answering essay questions. My school taught us Claim Support Question and Success Criteria to answer without describing too much. Maybe you can ask your teachers to recommend some skills. Content can be memorized nearer to the exams as long as you consistently understand it by clarifying and reading the notes. I‚Äôm not sure how bad your school notes are but hope this helps :-)', 'youtube.com/alevellessons may help!', 'Hi, would like to give my humble advise on the issue.\n\nFor the structure of each point in my essay, I use PEE(Cause&effect), with C&E meaning (i.e. when there is increased increase global average temperature due to global warming, there would be increased rate of physical weathering such as thermal fracture).\n\nThe point is the most difficult actually as it is the starting of your ""whole point"" meaning if you do not answer the question in the first place, the examiner does not even bother to read further and will most likely just give you zero. H2 geography may have some pretty challenging questions that are not so direct, so definitely work on your POINT more than anything else\n\nIn regards to your teacher not spoonfeeding you model answers, like i said, the question types are dynamic and unpredictable, if you merely memorize and do not train in the art of answering coherently, you will be punished. Your teacher does not want to cultivate mindless copy paste students but dynamic adaptive thinkers that can articulate their own points. \n\nIn regards to the technical aspects of H2 geography, while some aspects of physical geography and stuff like the milankovitch cycle (my favourite :D) require some technical rigour, the technical explanations are widely available online, perhaps you should not go view documentaries for that as they are meant for leisure consumption and easy digest rather than technical rigor.\n\nAl Jazeera, BBC and youtube has been my best friend for examples, as I find my own unique example separate from that given by my teachers, in a bid to ""standout"". Also learning your own contemporary examples allow you better context and understanding.\n\nThe synoptic linkages - I find this actually benefits the students more than punishes them, as it allows us to essentially not be restricted by any topic or theme, allowing for creativity that is actually rewarded!\n\nFinally, a consistent rigorous effort attacking the content everyday and not before the exams provides peace of mind and increased memorization ability.\n\nOverall, I would be that the subject is manageable. Get out of the mindset that H2 geography is hard and content is insurmountable, to geography is actually so easy and i get to also help my GP and Econs. Dont push all the blame to your tutors and malign them as if your poor grades were all their doing. Start taking initiative and ownership and you will see improvement.

"[poly] transferring out of jc to poly, feeling a little conflicted, any experiences?",Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1584766683.0,"hello! i recently took Os in 2019 and got myself r5 of 7 and r4 of 5. after much consideration, i decided to transfer to sp biomed because i don‚Äôt think i can handle the rigour at As (after seeing how much more difficult it is than Os + breaking down like every single day/having rly bad insomnia until my final paper during Os) although i ultimately scored ‚Äúwell‚Äù. moreover, i‚Äôve always thought of taking up biomed at poly, & i‚Äôm genuinely rly interested in the course. hence, after a month in jc, with me breaking down in front of my teacher and peers multiple times because i couldn‚Äôt understand content taught + having felt so hopeless, i decided to send an e-appeal to sp on the 12th of march, who then sent me an offer on the 16th of march. 

my family is really supportive of me transferring out after seeing how much stress i put on myself during Os (i really wanted to get into a jc) because i already know what i want to pursue in the future. my secondary school teachers, however, have been flaming me for doing so. they say things like i ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have taken triple science‚Äù or i ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have worked so hard‚Äù just for me to get a desirable r5 score and ‚Äúwaste it‚Äù. this has caused me to reconsider dropping out of jc and instead, force myself to like the syllabus just so i can shut them up, although i know biomed is something i know i want to do in the future. some of my friends have also been asking me to rethink my decision as if i had ‚Äúscored so well in Os‚Äù despite many challenges (it was a trying time for my family, which had a toll on my mental health), i should be able to sit for As and do well. i‚Äôm also a mugger, which also led them to comment how my study style is more suited towards jc rather than poly. 

on the other hand, i do understand many struggle in j1 and therefore it is only natural for me to do so too. that has also prompted me to rethink dropping out, although i really freaking hate gp/chinese/pw to death (i understand poly has projects too, but the difference is i‚Äôm interested in the modules taught). simultaneously, i really like h2 chem/math so far. jc is also a more ‚Äúdirect‚Äù path to uni & i‚Äôm a little scared i might not make it to uni from poly as the chances are more slim. i have also made many friends whose company i enjoy very much, and have even gotten close to quite a few of them. i really love my jc environment (the teachers, homey vibe, people) and ngl, it‚Äôs kinda hard for me to leave.

does anyone else have experiences of transferring out of poly or scoring really well for Os but still choosing poly? although i know poly is the better choice for me, things the world says do often get the better of me. i also don‚Äôt mind hearing what you guys think of my situation (: thank you for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fm9pcy/poly_transferring_out_of_jc_to_poly_feeling_a/,20,"["">my secondary school teachers, however, have been flaming me for doing so. they say things like i ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have taken triple science‚Äù or i ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have worked so hard‚Äù just for me to get a desirable r5 score and ‚Äúwaste it‚Äù.\n\nIt's pretty elitist of them to say such things imo."", '[deleted]', 'Poly maybe better.

[O level] physics is tough man,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,1584724509.0,I feel so stupid at times honestly. Like I'll be spending so much time trying to understand physics but always don't get it. Like it's so frustrating to see my friends all understanding the content and like not me. I'm so so scared for Os and I'm not even sure if I'm utilizing my time properly. I am to get l1r5 <9 but I'm not sure if that's even possible. It's so scary and frustrating man,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/flyqhl/o_level_physics_is_tough_man/,2,"['i was like u too. Took pure physics. Always failing my topical tests and barely passing exams. I nvr got a single digit L1R5 at all in my upper sec life. I even thought that it would be almost impossible for me to get a raw single digit. All my classmates could understand and digest the content so quickly while i was just there during the lessons, almost breaking down. I could not understand it at all. I was clueless af. But i didn‚Äôt give up. My sec 4 mye was a wake up call. I had to buck up for prelims and olevels. So when i stepped down from cca, i would have more time for consults. So i would constantly go for consults and ask teachers during lessons. Just shamelessly ask questions(it for ur benefit!). Don‚Äôt care if your questions sound stupid or not. I also would try to do as many papers as i could(depending on ur limit) so that i can ask the teachers if idu how to do. Physics is mainly based on application of concepts and formulas so most of the exam questions would have no fixed answers(besides definitions). So it‚Äôs important to really understand the concepts, then it would be easier for you to understand the questions. Trust me, things would get better. In the end, i got A1 for prelims and A2 for olevels(i messed up my practical yea). and i even got a single digit of 9 raw in Olevels.', 'Ngl physics is one tough subject..But hey as a person who went from complete fails to A2 in the end , id say its still possible to improve your physics grades as long as you dont give up! Try doing the tys topical to find out which topics youre weak in, and then consult your teacher as much as possible until u really undertand the topic. It may take awhile but please dont put yourself down by comparing to your friends, everyone learns at different paces. Just keep practicing physics questions and keep clarifying your doubts as soon as you have them, dont let it snowball. If i can do it, you most definitely can too!! Just keep pressing onüí™üí™', 'Sending encouragements to you! I was so bad at F9 physics I didnt know what i was doing in O levels only anyhow spam formulas but still managed to scrape by with a B3 lol, you can do it too! Btw physics doesnt have to be included in your L1R5 if you have more than 6 subjects', 'Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for this! Physics is not an easy subject to learn. Trust me... I found it difficult too when I first started out. \n\nBut, my teacher has always said that Physics is a subject where you understand and apply. Once you understand, applying won.‚Äôr be much of an issue. \n\nSince you identified your problem, which is that you have difficulty understanding the concepts, try using online learning resources such as Khan Academy, or just go to YouTube and search, ‚Äò(Topic name) O Level‚Äô. \n\nIf you find that you are still struggling, go for consultations with your teacher. Ask them questions, and keep on asking them until YOU understand. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed about asking more questions. No question is a stupid question. \n\nDon‚Äôt compare yourself with others as well. Everybody has different pace of learning and understanding. If you find that your friends grasped the concept, ask help from them. \n\nAll the best and do not give up! If you ever want someone to talk to, my DMs are open!', 'for me, physics was one of those subjects which i never really enjoyed and found really dry. for most topics, i felt like i didn‚Äôt actually truly understand what was going on, especially for topics like em and emi. \n\nfrom experience, the best thing to do is really just to practise. do your tys, prelim booklet papers, any other resources your school gives you. do bear in mind that physics prelim papers could be much harder than the actual o level papers in the tys, so don‚Äôt get too discouraged if you can‚Äôt do your prelim booklet papers. i know of a friend who worked really hard for her physics and practised a lot, and she got a1 in the end. so this method will definitely help to some extent. \n\nthat being said, quality should always be above quantity. don‚Äôt just mindlessly do papers just for the sake of doing them without attempting to understand what you are actually doing, or learning from your mistakes. it‚Äôs better to do fewer papers and fully understanding and learning from your mistakes in those few papers, as compared to doing many papers but not understanding what you‚Äôre doing for all of them. \n\nif you have any queries about questions in your papers or if you‚Äôre not clear about certain concepts or topics, go for consultations with your physics teacher. if you‚Äôre not comfortable with your physics teacher or if you find that he/she can‚Äôt teach well, then ask your classmates who are strong in physics for help, or another physics teacher if possible. it‚Äôs always better to seek help and to clear up misconceptions quickly than to keep quiet about them. this applies for other subjects as well!\n\nalso, just for some additional o level scoring tips, physics practical will play a part in pulling up your overall score. take all your lab practical practices seriously, because practicals can make or break your a1 or a2. that being said, knowing how to do practicals and following instructions isn‚Äôt enough, you need to know your concepts to some extent too because you very likely need to do some calculation stuff for your practical, which will require you to know your formulas. so you must finish your topical revision for the topics that might come out for practical (eg: light, electricity etc) before the actual o level practical. you must also know your sources of error and precautions well, they are very likely to test these and so if you know them well, you can easily get 1-2 ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù marks. \n\nanother area that you can score in is paper 1. cambridge, for some reason, really likes repeating questions. about 3 out of your 40 mcq questions would have come out before in your tys already. however, it‚Äôs not practical to memorise all the answers of your 400 mcq questions in your tys. so instead, what i did was i would mark out the questions i got wrong, and try to understand why i went wrong. a few days later, i would redo the same question again. if i still got it wrong, i would then resort to memorisation, just to be on the safe side. but of course, this should be your final resort, try to understand your errors instead first! and this only works for paper 1 because technically you can memorise a few questions and answers for mcqs since the questions are repeated anyway. do not ever try to memorise answers for paper 2. physics is a subject based on understanding and application, not memorisation. if you rely on memorisation all the way, you definitely can‚Äôt score much better than a b4 at best. \n\nfinally, you don‚Äôt actually need to count physics in your l1r5, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should not work hard for physics, and in fact it‚Äôs great to see that you‚Äôre reaching out for help and study tips early, at least this means you have time to work on and improve your physics. \n\nand it is very possible to get a raw single digit for your l1r5. just make sure that you do consistent revision for all your subjects, finish all your homework and pay attention in class. start revision early (it would be best if you started doing your o level notes now, or your topical revision! but take it easy and don‚Äôt mug too much yet, you don‚Äôt want to have to deal with a burnout), seek help and consultations if needed, and don‚Äôt ever lose faith in yourself. all the best for your o level exams!', ""Got any physics questions can just DM me, I'll try my best to reply on the same day"", ""hello my broskis! firstly i'd like to say don't worry so much and call yourself stupid because by taking the effort to study you're actually on the right track. keep that learning mindset alive!\n\njust some background: i was batch of 2019 and i scored A1 for pure physics in the Os. physics has never really been a struggle for me but i didnt have the interest so i didn't take it in JC haha . i was a big physics flop in sec 1 and 2 but i chose to take triple science for god knows what reason ahhhhh but thankfully i had a great teacher who gave me tips and guidance. so i hope the tips i give you will be helpful! it's a combination of what i've experimented with and found out, and my teacher's recommendation.\n\n1. pre-read lesson material before class\n\nlesson material- ppt slides, notes or textbook , wtv your teacher provides. if all else fails just watch videos haha\n\nspend 15-20min scanning thru and annotating lesson material the night before class.\n\nas you read, try to make sense of the material. make connections between key concepts (i think if you use the physics matters book, they have the learning outcomes and the section summary which you can use as a guide) Doesnt matter if you make foggy or weak connections or you cant actively recall the information. when you walk into class the next day , your mind won't be blank so it's easier to follow along. also the class should jog your memory and fortify your understanding of the concepts better.\n\nanother tip is that while reading, write down questions that you have about the concepts/ideas in the margins. if the teacher answers them, scribble the answer down beside it. if not, go up to them and ask. \n\nbasically how this works is that you identify concepts that will potentially stump you BEFORE the lesson so you can really look out for the explanations and logic DURING the lesson. if you know what to look out for then it makes everything 2x easier.\n\n2. make frequent references to the learning outcomes(LO)\n\nbecause they legit tell you what you need to know so you can weed out all the useless fluff and ignore that. if there are entire paragraphs talking about an example, i read, understand, and cross out. that shit aint gonna help you more than once and isnt even worth your time to study it because a 100 different scenarios pop up during exams and this probably isnt one of them. if you want, you can summarise it in 1-2 lines and include it in your own handwritten notes if that helps.\n\nof course it also tells you what you need to know so please highlight that or page flag it so you don't miss it out.\n\nwhen you understand them/fulfill them, use pencil to strike them off\n\nif you don't understand, re-read, watch vids, ask friends or ask teachers in that order. best to learn it yourself!\n\n3. do all your work the day you receive it and DO NOT COPY\n\nby doing your work on the day itself, you're making your brain work to make the connections and apply and integrate the newly-acquired knowledge. this really helps the info stick with you and can again help identify gaps in understanding which you can clarify.\n\n4. own notes(?)\n\nsome people don't make their own notes and that's totally fine. i don't want to dictate what note taking method you should use - you should find out what suits you. do summary sheets, mindmaps, flashcards, linear notes help? do some mtds help more than others? it may differ across subjects\n\nfor me i wrote my own notes and only studied from those because i made it really comprehensive but also to the point. in these notes i combined info from common mistakes, my own mistakes, worksheets, lessons, powerpoint slides and the textbooks into my own 'study guide'. literally studied these lil precious gemstones and they brought me straight As for every test and exam because hell they were like my own revision handbook. it is quite time-consuming though but if you manage your time well, you can do it. i managed to squeeze time out to study physics even though i had piano lesson 1 time a week and training 4 days a week and exco commitments so you should be fine as well. its rly worth it because you spend a hell lot of time on it, but then you only need to revise this set of notes next time. \n\nalso please don't kill yourself if you can't because they are many ways around it! its more important that you learn the content in the most efficient and comfortable way possible\n\n5. practicals\n\nuh huh this is the absolute worse. 2019 pract was a slap in the face because well wtf cambridge. practical was the best part of my 3 papers for me but i guess cambridge just crushed my hopes heheh. \n\nbut it's ok. now whatever practs you do, please note the learning outcomes and make sure you can do those. go for make-up practicals if you missed any. summarise your learning from the practical on post-its and piak them on the worksheet. die die study these and file them up in a separate file and treat this file like god before the practical exam. you treat your work nice, o level will treat you nice(not really but worth a shot).\n\nalso make sure you know your sf/dp rule, graphing, drawing table, SoE and AFI all those stuffs. compile your own list of SoE and AFI so you don't wrekt your brain during pract to think of those. be very accurate and meticulous when you do the paper, and pls make sure you start developing good pract skills. things like reading the qn first, multitasking, and answering qns while waiting for the setup(if theres time involved) bonus: helps with your other sciences too HAHAH\n\n6. error analysis\n\nok this one is damn die die important. right now you know you dont understand. but you also wanna know where you lose your marks and why. so every piece of marked work you receive, write down your mistakes on a postit and piak at the front so that you can revise that quickly without flipping thru your worksheet. \n\nit shd be in this format: topic-qn type(mcq/open ended)-summary of mistake-correct concept \n\nthat way you rly get to see what pulls the scores down and work on those weaknesses instead!\n\n\n\naight OP that's all for me. hope it helped ! all the best, and feel free to dm me if you need more help."", 'Your comment will not be visible until reviewed by a moderator as it contains blacklisted phrases.

[Poly] Polytechnic Student here. Sorry for ranting here.,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1584719956.0,"hello everyone, I am really sorry for ranting here although it should be a discussion page for topics related to school and other enquiries. I am a student who is currently studying in a local Polytechnic and a year has passed by very quickly. I have suffered from depression since the age of 13 while anxiety started by the time i was 15. On some days I just feel that it is just so difficult for me to get by while on some other days I feel that I am alright. I have been experiencing Lower Back pain for around close to 2 years already ever since my depression and anxiety has worsened. But just to be sure, does anyone else here experience backache because of the reason i have mentioned? It's okay if you do not wish to share your story with me if you feel uncomfortable I understand. 

Sometimes is it normal to feel some chest discomfort due to anxiety or panic attacks? I also feel as though I am unable to concentrate while feeling emotionally empty. Sometimes I would just cry when I am all alone and somehow I am able to hide all my sadness whenever I am infront of people. In addition to that, I score pretty decent results in school, not to brag but however sometimes i felt that i am not performing at my best yet due to all these factors because I was able to perform really well during my National Exams with a record of 5 distinctions with 6subjects. I am considering to pay a visit to my school counsellor or perhaps seek psychiatric treatment from public hospital or through a polyclinic. If let's say someone is under the age of 18 or is 18 and above. Do they have to inform your parents and do you need someone to be with you when you visit the hospital or polyclinic for Therapy?

Sadly, I am unable to tell my parents or anyone in my family about my depression and anxiety. I just feel that my parents and I are not really close to each other and sometimes we argue quite often. Because sometimes loud tones from my parents would agitate my mind and just make me feel sad. I do confide in some of my closest friends and they do provide me some comfort but i can't always rely on them all the time. Afterall, they are also Humans and they need some time to care for themselves as well. Sorry if i sound really selfish. Although there are suicidal thoughts from my mind at times, I told myself that I have to stay strong and to continue fighting and push on since I am able to hit my desired grades despite being in a poor mental state. I told myself to stay positive so that I can Motivate myself to achieve bigger things in the future. I hope that 1day I can work either as a secondary school teacher, Psychologist or as a pharmacist since I know that my I do not have the capabilities to be a doctor. 



sorry If I sound like a showoff and a selfish person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/flxedw/poly_polytechnic_student_here_sorry_for_ranting/,9,"[""> I have been experiencing Lower Back pain for around close to 2 years already ever since my depression and anxiety has worsened.\n\nDo get this pain checked out, 2 years is a long time to suffer and it could be a sign of something more serious, eg. slipped disc, kidney stones. Also, there's the possibility that this chronic pain is linked to your depression and anxiety. \n\n>Sometimes is it normal to feel some chest discomfort due to anxiety or panic attacks?\n\nYes, chest discomfort and pain is quite common. I usually feel like something is squeezing my chest and this contributes further to the feeling where you can't breathe. \n\n>unable to concentrate while feeling emotionally empty\n\nDecreased concentration is another symptom of depression. You can read more about them [here](https://gpnotebook.com/simplepage.cfm?ID=x20091123152205182440). \n\n>somehow I am able to hide all my sadness whenever I am infront of people.\n\nAt this point I just want to say that you are a strong person. It takes an enormous amount of effort to hide your pain and still carry on functioning. It's not exactly healthy but it's a coping mechanism that works. Whatever it takes.\n\n>I am considering to pay a visit to my school counsellor or perhaps seek psychiatric treatment from public hospital or through a polyclinic.\n\nPerhaps you might want to try your school counsellor first, who might be able to recommend more suitable agencies/services to seek out. It is a good starting point to find out how comfortable you are with taking to someone about personal issues. Also, it is free. Any sort of psychological/psychiatric help outside will cost you some money. \n\n>If let's say someone is under the age of 18 or is 18 and above. Do they have to inform your parents and do you need someone to be with you when you visit the hospital or polyclinic for Therapy?\n\nI don't know the exact guidelines for this, but generally if you're under 18 you're considered a minor. You may be able to visit a psychologist alone, but for psychiatrist (if you want to try medication) you'll probably need to be above 18/ be accompanied by an adult. A few private therapists I know generally don't take in clients below 18 too.\n\n>Sadly, I am unable to tell my parents or anyone in my family about my depression and anxiety.\n\nI personally feel you on this one, OP. Battling a mental health condition is tough enough, having little to no support from loved ones makes it even tougher. \n\n> there are suicidal thoughts from my mind at times, I told myself that I have to stay strong and to continue fighting and push on since I am able to hit my desired grades despite being in a poor mental state. \n\n>I hope that 1day I can work either as a secondary school teacher, Psychologist or as a pharmacist\n\nIt's good to know that you have a reason to keep fighting.

"[Uni] NUS BBA vs UK (LSE, UCL) Economics/Management for Corporate Finance",University :snoo_smile:,1584716456.0,"Hi all! 

I've got some questions regarding employment opportunities and the skillsets Business-type degrees that Singapore and UK both offer and their pathways towards a corporate finance career: 

Competition/Bell curve: The top 10% of NUS BBA cohort receive first-class honours (correct me if I'm wrong!), while UK courses like UCL Management Science have a staggering 40% first-class honour rate. Will banks rank first-class/second upper honours equally with UK's first-class honours percentage? Also, are NUS students known to be more competitive and hardworking than those from LSE/UCL?

Communication/presentation skills: I've been impressed with the confidence and eloquence of NUS BBA students that I've met personally. However, given that it is generally accepted that UK-educated students have strong verbal skills honed over time in the angmoh world, is there still a distinct difference between them and the locally educated ones?  

International Prestige: While NUS and LSE/UCL are strongly recruited from investment banks due to their prominent locations in financial centres, will the UK international experience (studying and working) be valued extremely very highly by local firms especially for a second job when returning to Singapore?

Any other inputs on corporate finance recruiting in UK and SG will be much appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/flwf4a/uni_nus_bba_vs_uk_lse_ucl_economicsmanagement_for/,26,"['I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just the finance course in NUS that has any chance of being competitive with LSE', ""Have a few seniors with relevant experience so I can answer some questions\n\n>Will banks rank first-class/second upper honours equally with UK's first-class honours percentage? \n\nYes, honours are viewed as a standard equivalent across all universities, regardless of percentage. Ivy League universities are notorious for boosting the grades of their students, but the practice has never been scrutinised and are seen as equivalent grades in that sense. The difference is that a FCH from LSE is more attractive than a FCH from NUS by virtue of prestige \n\n>Also, are NUS students known to be more competitive and hardworking than those from LSE/UCL?\n\nNo one has studied simultaneously in both systems so it‚Äôs very hard for anyone to answer this. However, LSE does have a reputation for being very rigorously academic, and the intellectual standards of the average student is of course higher in UCL/LSE. \n\n>given that it is generally accepted that UK-educated students have strong verbal skills honed over time in the angmoh world, is there still a distinct difference between them and the locally educated ones?  \n\nYes, the western education system is on an entirely different level than anything you‚Äôll observe in Singapore, even relative to our business course student population. All my teachers agree that studying in the UK will challenge Singaporeans far more because of the argumentative nature of the student population, and it makes for stronger graduates soft skills wise \n\n>will the UK international experience (studying and working) be valued extremely very highly by local firms especially for a second job when returning to Singapore?\n\nDepends on some factors. Your grades ultimately matter more than your university. However, all things held equal, an international graduate is ALWAYS sought after more than a local graduate precisely because of the international experience firms need in a city like Singapore. It‚Äôs an open secret that many local companies reserve jobs for graduates of certain international universities, and having those employment prospects is no joke."", 'Thanks for your reply!

But nevertheless, classroom management is still a very important aspect of being a teacher and honestly its not something one can easily handle until one experiences it themself. Student care centres generally have smaller classes and dare I say, most of them are generally well behaved, which is a far cry from the general school environment, and dealing with rebellious and naughty kids etc. I'd highly recommend taking up a role in a public school to gain some classroom exposure if that's what NIE is really looking for.

They are not any more or less well-behaved. \n\nThe jobscope of a student care teacher isn‚Äôt easy, it‚Äôs not just giving them food to eat, putting them to sleep, accompanying them to toilet or washing their backsides. We do conduct programmes/lessons too which needless to say, requires classroom management. The only difference is that we do not teach academic stuff from the syllabus, unlike MOE teachers. However, as compared to relief teachers, we certainly do more in this aspect of classroom management bcos we actually do teach something (eg. values, current affairs etc), unlike reliefs who only relay a message from the absent teacher to the class & try to get them to lower down their volume. \n\nAlso, 1 sc teacher is in charge of a class of 36, which is around the same size of a typical class in a public MOE sch.

[Poly] NP Final CGPA Results and a short rant,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,1584707855.0,"Hey guys, I just received my final results and it kinda sucks man. Was hoping my internship module would push my GPA up a little bit but in actuality, it went the opposite. Got B+ for my internship which pulled it down from 3.67 to 3.64.  I know it doesn't sound much but in this case, because I wanted to get into Business Admin in NUS which has an IGP 10th Percentile of 3.73, my chances of getting in I guess would be pretty slim. Just to add on, the Credit Unit for Internship Module is 22 so if I had gotten an A for it, my cumulative GPA would definitely have gone above 3.7.

All this just because my supervisor rated me average during her assessment of me. I have friends who just lepak whole day in office but because they have a nice supervisor, they got an A for their internship. Meanwhile I'm here working my ass off for my supervisor and ended up with just an average assessment rating from her. TBH I find it really unfair since we don't get to choose what company we want to intern at since it's all based on the school. So really it's just luck to see if you get a good supervisor or not.
